cyber attack against a restaurant chain's credit card system prompted the FBI to issue a warning last week that criminal hackers are using new malicious software to steal personal financial data. Investigators have identified software signatures used in a new point-of-sale malware called \"Punkey,\" named after the 1980s sitcom character Punky Brewster. [<a href=\"http://freebeacon.com/national-security/fbi-warns-retailers-of-new-credit-card-malware/\" target=\"_blank\">Washington Free Beacon</a>]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<em><strong>For Millions, Mobile Banking Now Trumps Going to a Branch</strong></em>\r\n\r\nIn the U.S., nearly one in four banking consumers, or 56 million people, consider themselves \"mobile first,\" primarily using a mobile device to access their checking accounts, according to a new study from Javelin Strategy &amp; Research. The number of people accessing their banks weekly via a mobile device is now equal to the numbers who visit a bank branch. Just four years ago, only 9% of banking consumers regularly reached for their smartphone or tablet. Now, that share has climbed to 27%. During that same period, weekly visitors to brick and mortar bank branches shrunk to 28% of bank customers from 40%. [<a href=\"http://www.financial-planning.com/news/reinvent_wealth/for-millions-mobile-banking-now-trumps-going-to-a-branch-study-finds-2693098-1.html\" target=\"_blank\">Financial Planning</a>]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<em><strong>Why the FireEye and Visa Pact Is a Game Changer in Cybersecurity</strong></em>\r\n\r\nVisa has announced a new contract with cybersecurity firm, FireEye, to protect consumers. The case might be a total \"game changer\" in cybersecurity going forward. FireEye and Visa announced they intend to work together to create tools and services to help merchants and issuers protect against advanced cyberattacks. The Visa and FireEye Community Threat Intelligence (CTI) offering will bring together threat information from both companies, allowing merchants and issuers to quickly detect and respond to attacks against their IT and payment infrastructure.

Starting in October 2015, businesses that don't accept <a href=\"http://www.lowcards.com/emv-compatible\" target=\"_blank\">EMV-chip credit cards</a> will be responsible for paying for fraud that occurs at the point of sale. 64% of small businesses are aware of EMV-chip cards, but only 42% are committed to accepting EMV payments and just 19% know about the October liability shift. Credit card issuers now are typically liable when fraud occurs.

But some restaurants are changing their reservation policy. Before you can write down the time and address, you will have to dig into your wallet for a credit card number. Then you are told that if you need to cancel without adequate notice--anywhere from a few hours to a full week before--you will have to pay a cancellation fee, which may be as low as $30 or as high as $200 a person. Or, in a twist that several restaurants have adopted, you may have to pay for the meal in advance in exchange for a ticket. If your plans change, it's your job to find someone to take the ticket off your hands.

New customers of <a href=\"http://www.lowcards.com/discover\" target=\"_blank\">Discover credit cards</a> do not have to go through any extra steps to take part in this offer. They simply use their card to make everyday purchases and the cash rewards they have accumulated in the first 12 months are automatically doubled on their one-year anniversary date.

Visa and MasterCard issuers JPMorgan Chase and Capital One have the highest-value rewards cards, while <a href=\"http://www.lowcards.com/american-express-credit-cards\" target=\"_blank\">American Express credit cards</a> offer the lowest.

This attack, delivered through poisoned apps, exploits the NFC feature allowing unethical hackers to steal money from victims' credit cards anytime the cards are near the victims' phone.

However, the federal inspector general who oversees the IRS predicted the agency could face additional computer attacks as preliminary investigation results show the cyber-thieves were part of an effort operated from Internet domains in Russia and other countries.

The company previously said the service would start as soon as July. The mobile payment market will top $142 billion by 2019, compared with $67 billion this year, according to Forrester Research.

the FBI to issue a warning last week that criminal hackers are using new malicious software to steal personal financial data. Investigators have identified software signatures used in a new point-of-sale malware called “Punkey,” named after the 1980s sitcom character Punky Brewster.

The number of people accessing their banks weekly via a mobile device is now equal to the numbers who visit a bank branch. Just four years ago, only 9% of banking consumers regularly reached for their smartphone or tablet. Now, that share has climbed to 27%. During that same period, weekly visitors to brick and mortar bank branches shrunk to 28% of bank customers from 40%.

Starting in October 2015, businesses that don’t accept <a href=\"http://www.lowcards.com/emv-compatible\" target=\"_blank\">EMV-chip credit cards</a> will be responsible for paying for fraud that occurs at the point of sale. 64% of small businesses are aware of EMV-chip cards, but only 42% are committed to accepting EMV payments and just 19% know about the October liability shift.

But some restaurants are changing their reservation policy. Before you can write down the time and address, you will have to dig into your wallet for a credit card number. Then you are told that if you need to cancel without adequate notice–anywhere from a few hours to a full week before–you will have to pay a cancellation fee, which may be as low as $30 or as high as $200 a person. Or, in a twist that several restaurants have adopted, you may have to pay for the meal in advance in exchange for a ticket. If your plans change, it’s your job to find someone to take the ticket off your hands.
