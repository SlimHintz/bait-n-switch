Part II' Trailer Ignites The Revolution","date":1433862720000,"timestamp":1433869020604,"body":"<p>[brightcove autostart=true  videoID=4285510082001 playerID=2540257919001]\r\n\r\nIn anticipation of&nbsp;<em>Jurassic World</em>, Lions Gate Entertainment has debuted the first trailer for&nbsp;<em>The Hunger Games: Mockingjay part II. </em>Since I have not read the books, I can only say in theory that this latest trailer seems relatively spoiler-free, with most of the footage hopefully coming from the first act of the picture and next to nothing coming from the second half of the film. Obviously I can't guarantee the accuracy of that statement, but none of the <em>Hunger Games&nbsp;</em>trailers have been remotely spoiler-y, and I have to hope they will follow suit as they wrap this thing up.&nbsp;As they round the final lap, Lionsgate deserves real kudos for how they've successfully sold this franchise to top-tier box office results without spoiling much of anything along the way. The three prior films had relatively spoiler-free marketing campaigns, which is ironic since they were based on books that anyone could read or look up on Wikipedia. Yet Lionsgate was confident enough in the inherent appeal of the material that they didn't feel the need to spell it all out for those watching the trailers on a computer screen or in a dark theater.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_be276aed5e524e7fa28a4942877ea052\" align=\"\" width=\"640\"]<img class=\"dam-image ap size-large wp-image-be276aed5e524e7fa28a4942877ea052\" src=\"http://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/be276aed5e524e7fa28a4942877ea052/640x0.jpg?fit=scale\" alt=\"\"> A woman is silhouetted against a billboard of the movie &ldquo;The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1&rdquo; in Bangkok, Thailand, Thursday, Nov. 20, 2014.&nbsp; (AP Photo/Sakchai Lalit)[/caption]\r\n\r\nSo now all there is left to do is see if the franchise can maintain its relatively high marks in terms of critical acclaim and box office glory. It's no secret that I have serious issues with the first film, but I would like to think that at least some of those qualms (the establishment of an artificial crowd pleasing morality in an inherently immoral environment) will feel less problematic when viewed as the first part of a four-part story that eventually became explicitly about the use of media and propaganda as a (theoretically) more powerful weapon in war than any bomb or gun. But at least in terms of box office, <em>The Hunger Games&nbsp;</em>has been an astonishing success. The first two films opened with $152 million and $158m respectively, ending with domestic takes of over $400m. It was the first franchise ever to have the first two installments top $400m and top the domestic box office in two consecutive years. The third film, which was clearly one-half of a long movie (the third book was cut in half), opened with \"only\" $121 million and ended its run with \"only\" $337m domestic, good for the second biggest grosser of the year behind the \"made 99% of its money in 2015\" release <em>American Sniper</em>.\r\n\r\n<em>Mockingjay part I&nbsp;</em>earned $752 million worldwide, outgrossing&nbsp;<em>The Hunger Games&nbsp;</em>worldwide ($691m) partially thanks to a 3D conversion in China, but ended up short of <em>Catching</em>&nbsp;<em>Fire</em>'s $867m haul. This time around, they are (sadly?) going full-3D, and the question, to the extent that it matters at this point, is whether or not the film can use the momentum over the whole \"the final chapter\" thing to match or exceed the first two films' $409m and $423m domestic totals and/or top the previous installments worldwide. Conventional wisdom says \"yes,\" as even the final <em>Twilight&nbsp;</em>film ended up being the biggest worldwide grosser of the franchise, with $829m worldwide (compared to $392m for the first film four years prior) and the last&nbsp;<em>Harry Potter&nbsp;</em>film (and the only one in wide release 3D) ended up with $381m domestic (a series high) and $1.3b worldwide.\r\n\r\nObviously the 3D will help a little in America and potentially a lot overseas, but nonetheless I'm a little disappointed that the franchise didn't stay 2D all the way to the finish line like <em>Twilight&nbsp;</em>and (thus far) the&nbsp;<em>Fast/Furious&nbsp;</em>franchise. Come what may, if <em>Mockingjay part II&nbsp;</em>crosses $400 million domestic, it will be the first franchise in history to have three $400m-grossing installments (not accounting for inflation of course), although it will soon likely be joined by <em>Star Wars: The Force Awakens&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Avengers: Infinity War part I</em> when the time comes. Anyway, that's enough for now. <em>The Hunger Games: Mockingjay part II&nbsp;</em>is directed by Francis Lawrence and stars <a href='http://www.forbes.com/profile/jennifer-lawrence/'>Jennifer Lawrence</a>, Josh Hutcherson, Liam Hemsworth, Woody Harrelson, Donald Sutherland, Julianne Moore, Philip Seymour Hoffman,&nbsp;Sam Claflin, Elizabeth Banks, Jena Malone, Jeffrey Wright, and Stanley Tucci. It opens on November 20th, 2015. We'll see, but it looks like the odds are most definitely in its favor.\r\n\r\n<em><strong>Also on Forbes:</strong></em>\r\n\r\n[gallery2012]\r\n</p><p id=\"mce_0\"></p>","description":" In anticipation of Jurassic World, Lions Gate Entertainment has debuted the first trailer for The Hunger Games: Mockingjay part II.

Obviously I can’t guarantee the accuracy of that statement, but none of the <em>Hunger Games&nbsp;</em>trailers have been remotely spoiler-y, and I have to hope they will follow suit as they wrap this thing up.&nbsp;As they round the final lap, Lionsgate deserves real kudos for how they’ve successfully sold this franchise to top-tier box office results without spoiling much of anything along the way. The three prior films had relatively spoiler-free marketing campaigns, which is ironic since they were based on books that anyone could read or look up on Wikipedia. Yet Lionsgate was confident enough in the inherent appeal of the material that they didn’t feel the need to spell it all out for those watching the trailers on a computer screen or in a dark theater.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_be276aed5e524e7fa28a4942877ea052\"> \n <img class=\"dam-image ap size-large wp-image-be276aed5e524e7fa28a4942877ea052\" src=\"http://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/be276aed5e524e7fa28a4942877ea052/640x0.jpg?fit=scale\" alt=\"\" /> \n <p class=\"wp-caption-text\">A woman is silhouetted against a billboard of the movie “The Hunger Games: Mockingjay – Part 1” in Bangkok, Thailand, Thursday, Nov. 20, 2014.&nbsp; (AP Photo/Sakchai Lalit)</p> \n</div>\n<p>So now all there is left to do is see if the franchise can maintain its relatively high marks in terms of critical acclaim and box office glory. It’s no secret that I have serious issues with the first film, but I would like to think that at least some of those qualms (the establishment of an artificial crowd pleasing morality in an inherently immoral environment) will feel less problematic when viewed as the first part of a four-part story that eventually became explicitly about the use of media and propaganda as a (theoretically) more powerful weapon in war than any bomb or gun. But at least in terms of box office, <em>The Hunger Games&nbsp;</em>has been an astonishing success. The first two films opened with $152 million and $158m respectively, ending with domestic takes of over $400m. It was the first franchise ever to have the first two installments top $400m and top the domestic box office in two consecutive years. The third film, which was clearly one-half of a long movie (the third book was cut in half), opened with “only” $121 million and ended its run with “only” $337m domestic, good for the second biggest grosser of the year behind the “made 99% of its money in 2015″ release <em>American Sniper</em>.</p>\n<div id=\"inread\" article-ad-inbody=\"inread\" class=\"inread\"></div>\n<p><em>Mockingjay part I&nbsp;</em>earned $752 million worldwide, outgrossing&nbsp;<em>The Hunger Games&nbsp;</em>worldwide ($691m) partially thanks to a 3D conversion in China, but ended up short of <em>Catching</em>&nbsp;<em>Fire</em>‘s $867m haul. This time around, they are (sadly?) going full-3D, and the question, to the extent that it matters at this point, is whether or not the film can use the momentum over the whole “the final chapter” thing to match or exceed the first two films’ $409m and $423m domestic totals and/or top the previous installments worldwide. Conventional wisdom says “yes,” as even the final <em>Twilight&nbsp;</em>film ended up being the biggest worldwide grosser of the franchise, with $829m worldwide (compared to $392m for the first film four years prior) and the last&nbsp;<em>Harry Potter&nbsp;</em>film (and the only one in wide release 3D) ended up with $381m domestic (a series high) and $1.3b worldwide.</p>\n<p>Obviously the 3D will help a little in America and potentially a lot overseas, but nonetheless I’m a little disappointed that the franchise didn’t stay 2D all the way to the finish line like <em>Twilight&nbsp;</em>and (thus far) the&nbsp;<em>Fast/Furious&nbsp;</em>franchise. Come what may, if <em>Mockingjay part II&nbsp;</em>crosses $400 million domestic, it will be the first franchise in history to have three $400m-grossing installments (not accounting for inflation of course), although it will soon likely be joined by <em>Star Wars: The Force Awakens&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Avengers: Infinity War part I</em> when the time comes. Anyway, that’s enough for now. <em>The Hunger Games: Mockingjay part II&nbsp;</em>is directed by Francis Lawrence and stars <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/profile/jennifer-lawrence/\" target=\"_self\">Jennifer Lawrence</a>, Josh Hutcherson, Liam Hemsworth, Woody Harrelson, Donald Sutherland, Julianne Moore, Philip Seymour Hoffman,&nbsp;Sam Claflin, Elizabeth Banks, Jena Malone, Jeffrey Wright, and Stanley Tucci.
