Changes","date":1433801400000,"timestamp":1433903825883,"body":"<i>Touchdown!</i>\r\n\r\nToday Apple has officially unveiled <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/gordonkelly/2015/06/05/apple-ios-9-preview-new-features/\">iOS 9</a> and, despite a very similar appearance, the ninth edition of iOS comes jam packed with welcome changes from its <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/gordonkelly/2015/04/17/apple-ios-8-3-nasty-bugs/\">troubled predecessor</a>.\r\n\r\nSo let&rsquo;s get straight to it and break down exactly where Apple has made the biggest changes from iOS 8 and the benefits they will bring to your&nbsp;iPhones and iPads:\r\n\r\n<b>Proactive Assistant</b>\r\n\r\nIn recent years Apple has made a conscious attempt to reduce its reliance on Google and the highlight of iOS 9 illustrates this strategy once more.\r\n\r\nLeaked late last week &lsquo;<a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/gordonkelly/2015/05/27/apple-ios-9-android-google-now/\">Proactive</a>&rsquo; is essentially Apple&rsquo;s version of Google Now: an assistant which aggregates data across Siri, Contacts, Calendar, Passbook, and third-party apps to create contextually aware real-time information.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_12200\" align=\"\" width=\"1035\"]<img class=\"size-full wp-image-12200\" src=\"http://blogs-images.forbes.com/gordonkelly/files/2015/06/Proactive.png\" alt=\"iOS 9 Proactive  - image credit Apple\"> iOS 9 Proactive - image credit Apple[/caption]\r\n\r\nThis ranges from map directions before a meeting (taking into account current traffic conditions), boarding passes ahead of a flight and automated calendar entries from emails and messages.\r\n\r\nIn addition (and in a break from Google Now) Proactive also recognises patterns in your daily schedule so, for example, if you run every morning listening to music when you connect your headphones in that time period Proactive will automatically open your music app. Proactive can be granular as well, differentiating what you listen to when running compared to the times you are usually driving (where it might typically be to podcasts or audiobooks).\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/gordonkelly/2015/05/12/iphone-6s-11-new-features/\">Read more - Massive iPhone 6S Leak Reveals 11 New Features</a>\r\n\r\nMuch like Google Now, Proactive will also open up this intelligence to third party apps but Apple stresses that none of your data leaves your phone - a clear dig at Google. Out the gate Proactive looks capable of competing head-on with the current version of Google Now, but not with the <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/gordonkelly/2015/05/29/android-m-vs-android-lollipop-whats-the-difference/\">radically enhanced version previewed in Android M</a>.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_12177\" align=\"\" width=\"1940\"]<img class=\"size-large wp-image-12177\" src=\"http://blogs-images.forbes.com/gordonkelly/files/2015/06/Siri-1940x1091.jpg\" alt=\"Siri is far more powerful in iOS 9 - Image credit Apple\"> Siri is far more powerful in iOS 9 - Image credit Apple[/caption]\r\n\r\n<b>New Siri </b>\r\n\r\nIn order to make the most of Proactive, Siri also needs to get a lot smarter in iOS 9- and it does.\r\n\r\nIn the new release Siri gains much wider support for natural language commands across all aspects of your phone. This means far more than just &ldquo;Is it raining?&rdquo; with examples given when searching camera photos like &ldquo;Show me photos from Utah from last August &ldquo; or in contextually aware Note taking like &ldquo;Remind me to get my coffee off the roof of the car when I get in&rdquo; (possible if used in conjunction with Apple CarPlay).\r\n\r\nApple is also making a big deal of Siri&rsquo;s greater accuracy, pointing to a 5% word recognition error rate. It will also open up further to third party apps with requests within Spotlight able to tie queries into specific apps, locations and searches.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_12201\" align=\"\" width=\"869\"]<img class=\"size-full wp-image-12201\" src=\"http://blogs-images.forbes.com/gordonkelly/files/2015/06/Siri-2.png\" alt=\"Siri combines further with Spotlight results - Image credit Apple\"> Siri combines further with Spotlight results - Image credit Apple[/caption]\r\n\r\n<b>Upgraded Spotlight </b>\r\n\r\nThe result of Proactive and &lsquo;super Siri&rsquo;? A new Spotlight. In iOS 9 swiping left on the homescreen will bring a rich page of contextual data with links to common contacts, suggested apps, geo-sourced local information, calendar events and more.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/gordonkelly/2015/05/26/apple-ios-9-leak-new-features-iphone-6s-changes/\">Read more - Apple iOS 9 Leak Confirms Biggest iPhone 6S Change</a>\r\n\r\nReal time search gets a boost too with a wider array of questions answered as you type (think calculations, conversions, weather, etc). Spotlight will also integrate with third party apps, which creates almost endless possibilities.\r\n\r\n<i>Next up: greater speed and battery life for current devices and proper split screen multitasking...</i>\r\n\r\n<!--nextpage-->\r\n\r\n<b>Faster, Longer Lasting iPhones and iPads</b>\r\n\r\nWhile &lsquo;new&rsquo; is welcome, the biggest cry from many users is simply for their devices to work faster and last longer&hellip; and in this respect iOS 9 is just what the doctor ordered.\r\n\r\nAs expected, iOS 9 is <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/gordonkelly/2015/02/09/ios9-features/\">all about optimisation</a>. Using the example of an iPhone 6 (no name drops for the <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/gordonkelly/2015/05/12/iphone-6s-11-new-features/\">heavily leaked iPhone 6S</a>), Apple claims iOS 9 will add an extra hour of usage (aka &lsquo;screen on&rsquo;) time and a new power saver mode will add another three hours when enabled.\r\n\r\nApple didn&rsquo;t delve into what features would be restricted in this low power state (or if the 3 hours was calculated based on a full charge), but it should help those looking to squeeze more juice out of their devices.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/gordonkelly/2015/04/13/apple-ios-8-3-has-3-great-secret-features/\">Read more - Apple iOS 8.3 Has 3 Great Secret Features</a>\r\n\r\n<b>iPad Multitasking</b>\r\n\r\nThis is potentially huge and something which can help bridge the gap in functionality between the PC and &lsquo;post PC&rsquo; eras: Split View and Picture-in-Picture.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_12196\" align=\"\" width=\"1940\"]<img class=\"size-large wp-image-12196\" src=\"http://blogs-images.forbes.com/gordonkelly/files/2015/06/SplitView-1940x1091.jpg\" alt=\"iPad split screen multitasking is  a massive iOS breakthrough - Image credit Apple\"> iPad split screen multitasking is a massive iOS breakthrough - Image credit Apple[/caption]\r\n\r\nAs the familiar names suggest, the former allows two concurrently running apps to be split into 50/50 or 70/30 proportions in landscape mode. The split is triggered by swiping from the right edge which produces a list of recent apps in the split. A selected app can then be &lsquo;glanced&rsquo; (viewed and dismissed) or locked in place for dedicated multitasking. A divider between the apps can be dragged to toggle between 50/50 and 70/30 splits (&lsquo;Slide Over&rsquo;).\r\n\r\nAs for picture-in-picture, this is exactly like what we&rsquo;ve seen on TVs for years. When playing video you&rsquo;ll be able to exit an app and keep the video window open, or even just its audio.\r\n\r\nThe combination of the two features means both productivity and slacking off potential will hit whole new levels. Sadly these levels will only be attained by some as a iPad Air 2 is required for the full functionality, while the iPad Air and iPad mini range will get support for just glanceable split screen apps and picture-in-picture. Other iPads are out of luck.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_12194\" align=\"\" width=\"1940\"]<img class=\"size-large wp-image-12194\" src=\"http://blogs-images.forbes.com/gordonkelly/files/2015/06/Slide-Over-1940x1091.jpg\" alt=\"iOS 9 multitasking 'glances' - Image credit Apple\"> iOS 9 multitasking 'glances' - Image credit Apple[/caption]\r\n\r\nInterestingly Apple did say iPhones would be compatible with Multitasking, but didn't elaborate. It would make sense for some of these features to come to the iPhone 6 Plus (and create a differentiator from the iPhone 6), though we await more information here.\r\n\r\nAs for compatible split screen apps, Apple states that any which use its &lsquo;Auto Layout&rsquo; coding feature can easily be made compatible. For others, the race to add to tick this box will begin in earnest - I suspect particularly among Twitter clients.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/gordonkelly/2015/04/15/galaxy-s6-vs-iphone-6-review/\">Read more - Galaxy S6 Vs iPhone 6 Review: Samsung Uses Apple To Beat Apple</a>\r\n\r\n<b>Better Apple Maps</b>\r\n\r\nLooking to shake off its unfashionable reputation, Apple says Apple Maps is now by far the most used mapping application on iOS (3.5x higher than &ldquo;next&nbsp;leading mapping app&rdquo;) and this should get a further bump as it was revealed iOS 9 will add much awaited transit directions.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_12185\" align=\"\" width=\"1940\"]<img class=\"wp-image-12185 size-large\" src=\"http://blogs-images.forbes.com/gordonkelly/files/2015/06/Maps-1940x1091.jpg\" alt=\"In iOS 9 Apple Maps adds detailed public transport informaiton - Image credit Apple\"> In iOS 9 Apple Maps adds detailed public transport information - Image credit Apple[/caption]\r\n\r\nThese will be limited to major US and Chinese cities initially, but do look worth the wait with a nice Google Maps differentiator being it recognises multiple exits at major airports and stations and plans your directions accordingly.\r\n\r\nIn a clever (and self serving) touch, Apple Maps will also now show whether any store, restaurant or bar supports Apple Pay in its search results.\r\n\r\n<i>Next: faster updates, better typing, notes and news...</i>\r\n\r\n<!--nextpage-->\r\n\r\n<b>Smaller iOS Updates</b>\r\n\r\nThis was somewhat glossed over in the keynote, but is vital to many: iOS updates will be drastically shrinking their space requirements so users can get them quickly and more easily.\r\n\r\nFor example, Apple states that the free space required on an iOS device to upgrade to iOS 8 was a whopping 4.6GB. By contrast, upgrading to iOS 9 will require just 1.3GB.\r\n\r\nGiven Apple still sells 16GB iPhones, iPads and iPod touches (and even an 8GB iPhone 5C) this will be music to the ears of their owners. Apple has already been working on improving this, but iOS 9 takes a quantum leap forward.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/gordonkelly/2015/04/09/apple-ios-8-3-touch-id-bug/\">Read more - Apple iOS 8.3 Has A Nasty New Bug</a>\r\n\r\n<b>Goodbye Newsstand, Hello News</b>\r\n\r\nApple spent a great deal of time talking up &lsquo;News&rsquo;, its replacement for the unloved &lsquo;Newsstand&rsquo; app which will launch in iOS 9. In a nutshell this is Apple&rsquo;s version of Flipboard and it allows users to pick topics of interest and then receive curated and beautifully presented articles.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_12189\" align=\"\" width=\"1940\"]<img class=\"size-large wp-image-12189\" src=\"http://blogs-images.forbes.com/gordonkelly/files/2015/06/News-2-1940x1091.jpg\" alt=\"Apple News is a major Flipboard rival - Image credit Apple\"> Apple News is a major Flipboard rival - Image credit Apple[/caption]\r\n\r\nThe former is a combination of both machine learning and real human researchers while the latter will allow for rich animations, consistent typography and detailed galleries.\r\n\r\nNews will initially be launched in the US, UK and Australia and Apple states a lot of major publications have signed up. That said it didn't break down the revenue split or earnings potential for publications (no ads were visible in the demos) which will be crucial to add more partners over time.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_12190\" align=\"\" width=\"1940\"]<img class=\"size-large wp-image-12190\" src=\"http://blogs-images.forbes.com/gordonkelly/files/2015/06/News-partners-1940x1091.jpg\" alt=\"Apple News initial partners - Image credit Apple\"> Apple News initial partners - Image credit Apple[/caption]\r\n\r\nWhether Apple can break through where other similar services have plateaued remains to be seen. If so, expect Google to bid for Flipboard in 2016!\r\n\r\n<b>QuickType</b>\r\n\r\nAnother iPad-centric feature, in iOS 9 QuickType will bring rich shortcuts to suggestion bar of the iOS virtual keyboard in landscape mode. This includes the likes of cut, copy, paste, adding attachments and more.\r\n\r\nIn addition a two finger touch on the keyboard makes it operate like a trackpad so you can scroll through a document, highlight text and so forth without having to move away from the keys.

Typically Apple cuts off a generation of hardware with each new generation of software and it suggests the company is putting its money where its mouth is on the claims iOS 9 will be faster and more efficient.\r\n\r\nSo to recap: iOS 9 will be available for the iPhone 4S, iPad 2, iPad mini, iPod touch 5th and any newer devices.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/gordonkelly/2015/04/09/apple-ios-8-3-wifried/\">Read more - Apple iOS 8.3 Finally Admits To A Massive Problem</a>\r\n\r\n<b>Early iOS 9 Access For All</b>\r\n\r\nGiven the <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/gordonkelly/2015/04/17/apple-ios-8-3-nasty-bugs/\">numerous bug fixes</a> in iOS 8, the good news for those desperate to get iOS 9 as soon as possible is Apple will be making the first beta available in July&hellip; and not only for developers.\r\n\r\nAn iOS 9 public beta will also be made available at the same time (from <a href=\"https://beta.apple.com/sp/betaprogram/\">beta.apple.com</a>) so anyone interested can hop aboard. As with any beta software, this comes with obvious bug warnings, but opens up an exciting new avenue for users and much wider testing pool for Apple ahead of official releases.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_12204\" align=\"\" width=\"1024\"]<img class=\"size-full wp-image-12204\" src=\"http://blogs-images.forbes.com/gordonkelly/files/2015/06/iOS-9.png\" alt=\"iOS 9 still has plenty more to come- Image credit Apple\"> iOS 9 still has plenty more to come- Image credit Apple[/caption]\r\n\r\n<i>Initial iOS 9 Feelings</i>\r\n\r\nI&rsquo;ll be dealing with the best/worst aspects of iOS 9 and its <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/gordonkelly/2015/05/26/apple-ios-9-leak-new-features-iphone-6s-changes/\">major omissions</a> in separate posts , but my overriding feeling from Apple&rsquo;s new OS is one of polish and refinement.\r\n\r\nApple is clearly focused on making iOS 9 as fast, light and efficient as possible to be a rock solid base for the company&rsquo;s jump into IoT, streaming services (hello <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/jaymcgregor/2015/06/08/apple-music-vs-spotify-vs-tidal-everything-you-need-to-know/?utm_source=followingimmediate&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=20150608\">Apple Music</a>) and bridging the gap to OS X with powerful multitasking. Tim Cook stressed many users now see iPads as their main computer and the extra love iOS 9 gives to the iPad shows Cook has interest in capitalising on that and pulling market share away from cheap PCs.\r\n\r\nAnd if you&rsquo;re disappointed with what you've seen from iOS 9 so far, don&rsquo;t be. I expect plenty more surprises still to emerge from iOS 9 before it is formally released. Why? Well the company was never going to discuss the upcoming iPhone 6S and iPhone 6S Plus, so any iOS 9 aspects central to them were always going to remain on the cutting room floor tonight (I'm looking at you <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/gordonkelly/2015/05/26/apple-ios-9-leak-new-features-iphone-6s-changes/\">Force Touch</a>).\r\n\r\nAs such I'm convinced the best and most exciting aspects to iOS 9 still lie ahead&hellip;\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/gordonkelly/2015/06/05/iphone-6s-release-date/\">Read more - iPhone 6S Release Date Leaked Via Major Carrier</a>\r\n\r\n[gallery2012]\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n<a class=\"twitter-follow-button\" href=\"https://twitter.com/GordonKelly\">Follow @GordonKelly</a>","description":"Apple's next major operating system has been announced, these are the big changes...","image":"http://blogs-images.forbes.com/gordonkelly/files/2015/06/Proactive.png","type":"blogslide","storyType":"post","uri":"http://www.forbes.com/sites/gordonkelly/2015/06/08/apple-ios-9s-biggest-updates-everything-you-need-to-know/","comments":[],"visible":true,"blogId":"2907","authors":[{"naturalId":"blogAuthorId/blog/author/1017581","name":"Gordon Kelly","avatars":[{"size":136,"image":"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/135313297429b8a66b069508000b1134?s=136&amp;d=http%3A%2F%2F1.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2Fad516503a11cd5ca435acc9bb6523536%3Fs%3D136&amp;r=G"},{"size":40,"image":"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/135313297429b8a66b069508000b1134?s=40&amp;d=http%3A%2F%2F1.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2Fad516503a11cd5ca435acc9bb6523536%3Fs%3D40&amp;r=G"},{"size":400,"image":"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/135313297429b8a66b069508000b1134?s=400&amp;d=http%3A%2F%2F1.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2Fad516503a11cd5ca435acc9bb6523536%3Fs%3D400&amp;r=G"},{"size":62,"image":"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/135313297429b8a66b069508000b1134?s=62&amp;d=http%3A%2F%2F1.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2Fad516503a11cd5ca435acc9bb6523536%3Fs%3D62&amp;r=G"}],"url":"http://www.forbes.com/sites/gordonkelly/","type":"Contributor","profileUrl":"/sites/gordonkelly/","twitterName":"gordonkelly","authorType":"individual","linkedIn":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/gordonkelly","email":"gordon@gordonkelly.com","blog":false,"numFollowers":0,"shortBio":"I write about technology's biggest companies","webSite":"http://www.gordonkelly.com","timestamp":1445787822844,"description":"I am an experienced freelance technology journalist.

unveiled <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/gordonkelly/2015/06/05/apple-ios-9-preview-new-features/\" target=\"_self\">iOS 9</a> and, despite a very similar appearance, the ninth edition of iOS comes jam packed with welcome changes from its <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/gordonkelly/2015/04/17/apple-ios-8-3-nasty-bugs/\" target=\"_self\">troubled predecessor</a>.</p>\n<p>So let’s get straight to it and break down exactly where Apple has made the biggest changes from iOS 8 and the benefits they will bring to your&nbsp;iPhones and iPads:</p>\n<p><b>Proactive Assistant</b></p>\n<p>In recent years Apple has made a conscious attempt to reduce its reliance on Google and the highlight of iOS 9 illustrates this strategy once more.</p>\n<p>Leaked late last week ‘<a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/gordonkelly/2015/05/27/apple-ios-9-android-google-now/\" target=\"_self\">Proactive</a>’ is essentially Apple’s version of Google Now: an assistant which aggregates data across Siri, Contacts, Calendar, Passbook, and third-party apps to create contextually aware real-time information.</p>\n<div id=\"inread\" article-ad-inbody=\"inread\" class=\"inread\"></div>\n<div id=\"attachment_12200\"> \n <img class=\"size-full wp-image-12200\" src=\"http://blogs-images.forbes.com/gordonkelly/files/2015/06/Proactive.png\" alt=\"iOS 9 Proactive  - image credit Apple\" /> \n <p class=\"wp-caption-text\">iOS 9 Proactive – image credit Apple</p> \n</div>\n<p>This ranges from map directions before a meeting (taking into account current traffic conditions), boarding passes ahead of a flight and automated calendar entries from emails and messages.</p>\n<p>In addition (and in a break from Google Now) Proactive also recognises patterns in your daily schedule so, for example, if you run every morning listening to music when you connect your headphones in that time period Proactive will automatically open your music app. Proactive can be granular as well, differentiating what you listen to when running compared to the times you are usually driving (where it might typically be to podcasts or audiobooks).</p>\n<div class=\"vestpocket\"

Features</a></p>\n<p>Much like Google Now, Proactive will also open up this intelligence to third party apps but Apple stresses that none of your data leaves your phone – a clear dig at Google. Out the gate Proactive looks capable of competing head-on with the current version of Google Now, but not with the <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/gordonkelly/2015/05/29/android-m-vs-android-lollipop-whats-the-difference/\" target=\"_self\">radically enhanced version previewed in Android M</a>.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_12177\"> \n <img class=\"size-large wp-image-12177\" src=\"http://blogs-images.forbes.com/gordonkelly/files/2015/06/Siri-1940x1091.jpg\" alt=\"Siri is far more powerful in iOS 9 - Image credit Apple\" /> \n <p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Siri is far more powerful in iOS 9 – Image credit Apple</p> \n</div>\n<p><b>New Siri </b></p>\n<p>In order to make the most of Proactive, Siri also needs to get a lot smarter in iOS 9- and it does.</p>\n<p>In the new release Siri gains much wider support for natural language commands across all aspects of your phone. This means far more than just “Is it raining?” with examples given when searching camera photos like “Show me photos from Utah from last August “ or in contextually aware Note taking like “Remind me to get my coffee off the roof of the car when I get in” (possible if used in conjunction with Apple CarPlay).</p>\n<p>Apple is also making a big deal of Siri’s greater accuracy, pointing to a 5% word recognition error rate. It will also open up further to third party apps with requests within Spotlight able to tie queries into specific apps, locations and searches.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_12201\"> \n <img class=\"size-full wp-image-12201\" src=\"http://blogs-images.forbes.com/gordonkelly/files/2015/06/Siri-2.png\" alt=\"Siri combines further with Spotlight results - Image credit Apple\" /> \n <p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Siri combines further with Spotlight results – Image credit Apple</p> \n</div>\n<p><b>Upgraded Spotlight </b></p>\n<p>The result of Proactive and ‘super Siri’? A new Spotlight. In iOS 9 swiping left on the homescreen will bring a rich page of contextual data with links to common contacts, suggested apps, geo-sourced local information, calendar events and more.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/gordonkelly/2015/05/26/apple-ios-9-leak-new-features-iphone-6s-changes/\" target=\"_self\">Read more – Apple iOS 9 Leak Confirms Biggest iPhone 6S Change</a></p>\n<p>Real time search gets a boost too with a wider array of questions answered as you type (think calculations, conversions, weather, etc). Spotlight will also integrate with third party apps, which creates almost endless possibilities.</p>\n<p><i>Next up: greater speed and battery life for current devices and proper split screen multitasking…</i></p>","<p><b>Faster, Longer Lasting iPhones and iPads</b></p>\n<p>While ‘new’ is welcome, the biggest cry from many users is simply for their devices to work faster and last longer… and in this respect iOS 9 is just what the doctor ordered.</p>\n<p>As expected, iOS 9 is <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/gordonkelly/2015/02/09/ios9-features/\" target=\"_self\">all about optimisation</a>. Using the example of an iPhone 6 (no name drops for the <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/gordonkelly/2015/05/12/iphone-6s-11-new-features/\" target=\"_self\">heavily leaked iPhone 6S</a>), Apple claims iOS 9 will add an extra hour of usage (aka ‘screen on’) time and a new power saver mode will add another three hours when enabled.</p>\n<p>Apple didn’t delve into what features would be restricted in this low power state (or if the 3 hours was calculated based on a full charge), but it should help those looking to squeeze more juice out of their devices.</p>\n<div id=\"inread\" article-ad-inbody=\"inread\" class=\"inread\"></div>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/gordonkelly/2015/04/13/apple-ios-8-3-has-3-great-secret-features/\" target=\"_self\">Read more – Apple iOS 8.3 Has 3 Great Secret Features</a></p>\n<p><b>iPad Multitasking</b></p>\n<p>This is potentially huge and something which can help bridge the gap in functionality between the PC and ‘post PC’ eras: Split View and Picture-in-Picture.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_12196\"> \n <img class=\"size-large wp-image-12196\" src=\"http://blogs-images.forbes.com/gordonkelly/files/2015/06/SplitView-1940x1091.jpg\" alt=\"iPad split screen multitasking is  a massive iOS breakthrough - Image credit Apple\" /> \n <p class=\"wp-caption-text\">iPad split screen multitasking is a massive iOS breakthrough – Image credit Apple</p> \n</div>\n<div class=\"vestpocket\" vest-pocket=\"\"></div>\n<p>As the familiar names suggest, the former allows two concurrently running apps to be split into 50/50 or 70/30 proportions in landscape mode. The split is triggered by swiping from the right edge which produces a list of recent apps in the split. A selected app can then be ‘glanced’ (viewed and dismissed) or locked in place for dedicated multitasking. A divider between the apps can be dragged to toggle between 50/50 and 70/30 splits (‘Slide Over’).</p>\n<p>As for picture-in-picture, this is exactly like what we’ve seen on TVs for years. When playing video you’ll be able to exit an app and keep the video window open, or even just its audio.</p>\n<p>The combination of the two features means both productivity and slacking off potential will hit whole new levels. Sadly these levels will only be attained by some as a iPad Air 2 is required for the full functionality, while the iPad Air and iPad mini range will get support for just glanceable split screen apps and picture-in-picture. Other iPads are out of luck.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_12194\"> \n <img class=\"size-large wp-image-12194\" src=\"http://blogs-images.forbes.com/gordonkelly/files/2015/06/Slide-Over-1940x1091.jpg\" alt=\"iOS 9 multitasking 'glances' - Image credit Apple\" /> \n <p class=\"wp-caption-text\">iOS 9 multitasking ‘glances’ – Image credit Apple</p> \n</div>\n<p>Interestingly Apple did say iPhones would be compatible with Multitasking, but didn’t elaborate. It would make sense for some of these features to come to the iPhone 6 Plus (and create a differentiator from the iPhone 6), though we await more information here.</p>\n<p>As for compatible split screen apps, Apple states that any which use its ‘Auto Layout’ coding feature can easily be made compatible. For others, the race to add to tick this box will begin in earnest – I suspect particularly among Twitter clients.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/gordonkelly/2015/04/15/galaxy-s6-vs-iphone-6-review/\" target=\"_self\">Read more – Galaxy S6 Vs iPhone 6 Review: Samsung Uses Apple To Beat Apple</a></p>\n<p><b>Better Apple Maps</b></p>\n<p>Looking to shake off its unfashionable reputation, Apple says Apple Maps is now by far the most used mapping application on iOS (3.5x higher than “next&nbsp;leading mapping app”) and this should get a further bump as it was revealed iOS 9 will add much awaited transit directions.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_12185\"> \n <img class=\"wp-image-12185 size-large\" src=\"http://blogs-images.forbes.com/gordonkelly/files/2015/06/Maps-1940x1091.jpg\" alt=\"In iOS 9 Apple Maps adds detailed public transport informaiton - Image credit Apple\" /> \n <p class=\"wp-caption-text\">In iOS 9 Apple Maps adds detailed public transport information – Image credit Apple</p> \n</div>\n<p>These will be limited to major US and Chinese cities initially, but do look worth the wait with a nice Google Maps differentiator being it recognises multiple exits at major airports and stations and plans your directions accordingly.</p>\n<p>In a clever (and self serving) touch, Apple Maps will also now show whether any store, restaurant or bar supports Apple Pay in its search results.</p>\n<p><i>Next: faster updates, better typing, notes and news…</i></p>","<p><b>Smaller iOS Updates</b></p>\n<p>This was somewhat glossed over in the keynote, but is vital to many: iOS updates will be drastically shrinking their space requirements so users can get them quickly and more easily.</p>\n<p>For example, Apple states that the free space required on an iOS device to upgrade to iOS 8 was a whopping 4.6GB. By contrast, upgrading to iOS 9 will require just 1.3GB.</p>\n<p>Given Apple still sells 16GB iPhones, iPads and iPod touches (and even an 8GB iPhone 5C) this will be music to the ears of their owners. Apple has already been working on improving this, but iOS 9 takes a quantum leap forward.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/gordonkelly/2015/04/09/apple-ios-8-3-touch-id-bug/\" target=\"_self\">Read more – Apple iOS 8.3 Has A Nasty New Bug</a></p>\n<p><b>Goodbye Newsstand, Hello News</b></p>\n<div id=\"inread\" article-ad-inbody=\"inread\" class=\"inread\"></div>\n<p>Apple spent a great deal of time talking up ‘News’, its replacement for the unloved ‘Newsstand’ app which will launch in iOS 9.

This includes the likes of cut, copy, paste, adding attachments and more.</p>\n<p>In addition a two finger touch on the keyboard makes it operate like a trackpad so you can scroll through a document, highlight text and so forth without having to move away from the keys.

Tim Cook stressed many users now see iPads as their main computer and the extra love iOS 9 gives to the iPad shows Cook has interest in capitalising on that and pulling market share away from cheap PCs.</p>\n<p>And if you’re disappointed with what you’ve seen from iOS 9 so far, don’t be. I expect plenty more surprises still to emerge from iOS 9 before it is formally released. Why? Well the company was never going to discuss the upcoming iPhone 6S and iPhone 6S Plus, so any iOS 9 aspects central to them were always going to remain on the cutting room floor tonight (I’m looking at you <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/gordonkelly/2015/05/26/apple-ios-9-leak-new-features-iphone-6s-changes/\" target=\"_self\">Force Touch</a>).</p>\n<p>As such I’m convinced the best and most exciting aspects to iOS 9 still lie ahead…</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/gordonkelly/2015/06/05/iphone-6s-release-date/\" target=\"_self\">Read more – iPhone 6S Release Date Leaked Via Major Carrier</a></p>\n<div class=\"article-gallery-embedded\" data-url=\"http://www.forbes.com/pictures/fmdk45efeil/galaxy-s6-left-versus-ip/\"> \n <div class=\"embedded-content clearfix\"> \n  <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/pictures/fmdk45efeil/galaxy-s6-left-versus-ip/\" class=\"clearfix\" target=\"_self\"> \n   <div class=\"article-image-box\"> \n    <!--start:main_image--> \n    <img src=\"http://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/552ee7a0e4b0405618bda233/400x400.jpg?fit=scale&amp;background=000000\" alt=\"\" /> \n    <!--end:main_image--> \n   </div> \n   <div class=\"article-text-box\"> \n    <header> \n     <i class=\"icon icon-gallery\"></i>Gallery \n    </header> \n    <h4>Galaxy S6 vs iPhone 6</h4> \n    <div class=\"article-launch-gallery\"> \n     <span class=\"article-launch-text\">Launch Gallery</span> \n     <div class=\"article-slide-count\">\n       16 images \n     </div> \n    </div> \n    <button class=\"article-launch-button\"><i class=\"icon icon-chevron-right\"></i></button> \n   </div></a> \n </div> \n</div>\n<p>___</p>\n<p><a class=\"twitter-follow-button\" href=\"https://twitter.com/GordonKelly\">Follow @GordonKelly</a></p>"],"galleryId":"552ee77ce4b0405618bda217","disableDigest":false,"writtenByForbesStaff":false,"channelSectionMappings":[{"id":"channel_1section_191","channelName":"Business","sectionName":"Powering Productivity","url":"/powering-productivity"},{"id":"channel_3","channelName":"Tech","url":"/technology"},{"id":"channel_3section_22","channelName":"Tech","sectionName":"Mobile","url":"/mobile"}],"digestDisabled":false,"brandVoiceTitle":"iOS 9 Vs iOS 8: Apple's Biggest Changes","groupAuthor":{"naturalId":"blogAuthorId/blog/author/blog-2907","avatars":[{"size":0},{"size":0},{"size":0},{"size":0}],"url":"http://www.forbes.com/sites/gordonkelly/","profileUrl":"http://blogs.forbes.com/gordonkelly/profile/","twitterName":"gordonkelly","authorType":"individual","linkedIn":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/gordonkelly","blog":true,"numFollowers":0,"timestamp":1445787791202,"primaryBlogNaturalId":"blogAuthorId/blog/author/blog-2907","primaryContributor":"blogAuthorId/blog/author/1017581","primaryContributorData":{"naturalId":"blogAuthorId/blog/author/1017581","name":"Gordon Kelly","avatars":[{"size":40,"image":"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/135313297429b8a66b069508000b1134?s=40&amp;d=http%3A%2F%2F1.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2Fad516503a11cd5ca435acc9bb6523536%3Fs%3D40&amp;r=G"},{"size":62,"image":"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/135313297429b8a66b069508000b1134?s=62&amp;d=http%3A%2F%2F1.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2Fad516503a11cd5ca435acc9bb6523536%3Fs%3D62&amp;r=G"},{"size":136,"image":"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/135313297429b8a66b069508000b1134?s=136&amp;d=http%3A%2F%2F1.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2Fad516503a11cd5ca435acc9bb6523536%3Fs%3D136&amp;r=G"},{"size":400,"image":"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/135313297429b8a66b069508000b1134?s=400&amp;d=http%3A%2F%2F1.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2Fad516503a11cd5ca435acc9bb6523536%3Fs%3D400&amp;r=G"}],"blog":false,"numFollowers":0,"shortBio":"I write about technology's biggest companies","description":"I am an experienced freelance technology journalist.
