And despite having the gold medal around their necks at that tournament, the Americans still feel like they have some unfinished business. The penalty shootout defeat to Japan in the 2011 Women's World Cup final still sticks in the craw of the U.S. team, and it has been <a href="/espnw/news-commentary/2015worldcup/article/13008603/ending-drought-uswnt-learned-2011-world-cup-loss">16 years since the Americans last hoisted the trophy</a>.</p><p>After a month of being cooped up in training camp, the energy in the U.S. squad is palpable as the Americans prepare to face Australia on Monday evening (7:30 p.m. ET).</p><p>"I'm anxious," admitted U.S. defender Becky Sauerbrunn at Saturday's news conference. "I need [the tournament] to start."</p><p>It won't be long until she gets her wish.</p><h2>What's on the line?</h2><div class="mod-container mod-no-footer mod-inline content-box floatright mod-no-header-footer"><div class="mod-content"><h4>More from espnW.com</h4><p><a target="_blank" href="/espnw/news-commentary/2015worldcup/article/13027378/jill-ellis-counting-loaded-us-front-line-lead-way-women-world-cup">Coach Ellis counting on loaded front line to lead USWNT</a><p><p><a target="_blank" href="/espnw/news-commentary/article/12976615/detailed-look-hope-solo-domestic-violence-case-includes-reports-being-belligerent-jail">Inside Hope Solo's domestic violence case</a><p><p><a target="_blank" href="/espnw/news-commentary/2015worldcup/article/13006977/how-getting-cut-helped-carli-lloyd-refocus-find-spot-us-women-national-team">Once-cut Lloyd leads USWNT into World Cup</a><p><p><a target="_blank" href="/espnw/news-commentary/slideshow/12999754/top-10-players-women-world-cup">Top 10 players in the Women's World Cup</a><p><p><a target="_blank" href="/espnw/news-commentary/2015worldcup/article/13008603/ending-drought-uswnt-learned-2011-world-cup-loss">Foudy: How the USWNT can end World Cup drought, Part III</a><p><p><a target="_blank" href="/espnw/news-commentary/2015worldcup/article/13016297/how-julie-foudy-women-world-cup-bracket-unfold">Foudy: How the Women's World Cup bracket will unfold</a><p><p><a target="_blank" href="/espnw/news-commentary/2015worldcup/article/13019681/espnw-women-world-cup-expert-picks">espnW Women's World Cup expert picks</a><p><p><a target="_blank" href="/espnw/sport/world-cup/">Complete Women's World Cup coverage</a><p></div></div><p>With the tournament now expanded to 24 teams, the first round has become much more forgiving. In addition to the top two finishers in each group progressing to the knockout stages, the four best third-place teams will also advance. A hiccup or a poor performance need not be fatal.</p><p>But there is considerable value in seizing control of Group D. Not only would a win give the victor a significant confidence boost, but also the distance traveled for the group winner is considerably less than that for the group runner-up. A victory on Monday would amount to a giant step toward making life easier in the knockout stages.</p><h2>Style and tactics</h2><p>Australia plays a proactive 4-3-3 that features the team pressing high up the field. But the Matildas are also capable of striking on the counter and exploiting the pace of forwards Lisa De Vanna, Michelle Heyman and Sam Kerr.</p><p>After tinkering with a variety of formations and personnel, U.S. manager Jill Ellis has settled upon a 4-4-2 formation that features outside backs Ali Krieger and Meghan Klingenberg pushing up into the attack. Ellis also wants to see her team be more dangerous in transition, the better to utilize the speed of forwards like Sydney Leroux, Amy Rodriguez and Christen Press.</p><h2>Players to watch</h2><p><b>For Australia:</b> De Vanna, Katrina Gorry, Clare Polkinghorne</p><p>De Vanna is a pest to opposing defenders, and also has the ability to pick out a defense-splitting pass. Gorry -- nicknamed "Mini" due to her 5-foot-1 frame -- has emerged as an attacking force able to create something out of nothing, and is the 2014 AFC Player of the Year. Polkinghorne provides a veteran presence in the back and will be counted on to keep the Matildas organized. But the center back has been dealing with a hamstring injury and her availability is in question.</p><p><b>For the United States:</b> Carli Lloyd, Lauren Holiday, Klingenberg</p><p>Lloyd's reputation as a player who <a href="/espnw/news-commentary/2015worldcup/article/13006977/how-getting-cut-helped-carli-lloyd-refocus-find-spot-us-women-national-team">delivers in the clutch</a> is well deserved; she has twice scored the game winner in an Olympic final. She will be counted on to help orchestrate the U.S. attack. Holiday has been moved into more of a holding role over the past year with mixed results. In addition to bringing the ball out of the back, she'll need to make sure she gets her tackles in. Klingenberg is one of the most inexperienced players in the U.S. lineup, and she'll need to be mindful of when to get forward and when to hold.</p><h2>And then there's Hope</h2><figure class="article-img article-img-right article-img-square" style="max-width: 300px;"><div class="media-wrap"><span class="media-responsive" data-src="/photo/2015/0602/espnw_g_solo_usa_300x300.jpg" data-raw-width="300" data-raw-height="300" style="padding-bottom: 100%;" data-alt="Hope Solo" data-start-on-click="false"><noscript><img alt="Hope Solo" class="img-responsive" src="http://a2.espncdn.com/photo/2015/0602/espnw_g_solo_usa_300x300.jpg"></noscript></span></div><figcaption class="article-img-caption"><div class="article-img-source">Buda Mendes/Getty Images</div><p>Hope Solo heads into the World Cup with 170 caps -- and once again mired in controversy.</p></figcaption></figure><p>U.S. goalkeeper Hope Solo has by all appearances been a model citizen since being suspended from the team for 30 days back in January, when her husband, Jerramy Stevens, was charged with DUI while driving a U.S. Soccer van with Solo as a passenger. This was on top of the domestic violence charges that were filed and later dropped against Solo last year.</p><p>But ESPN.com <a href="/espnw/news-commentary/article/12976615/detailed-look-hope-solo-domestic-violence-case-includes-reports-being-belligerent-jail">obtained documents</a> that contradict some of what Solo has been telling the public with regard to the domestic violence case, and the Kirkland, Washington, prosecutors have appealed to have the case reopened. Both Solo and the U.S. team have proved able to deal with such distractions in the past, but how both team and player deal with the attention this time will be worth noting going forward. For the moment, the approach of Ellis is to <a href="/espnw/news-commentary/article/13032812/us-women-national-team-supportive-hope-solo-amid-domestic-violence-case-eve-world-cup">simply ignore the report</a> and the attention surrounding it.</p><p>"Hope's been fantastic," Ellis said. "That [case] was a long time ago. I'll be honest, we've moved on, and she's been a fantastic player and teammate. None of that has even resonated with us and I'm sure some of the players aren't even aware of it."</p><h2>What we can expect</h2><p>Look for Australia to test Klingenberg early and often through De Vanna, who at age 30 still possesses impressive speed. Fellow forwards Michelle Heyman and Kerr also pose similar problems. The United States can be thrown off its game by teams that press high, but the Matildas will need to be selective as to when they push up. Mexico tried a similar tactic against the U.S. women in a pre-World Cup friendly, and gave up repeated breakaways thanks to the timing and speed of Leroux.</p><figure class="article-img article-img-right article-img-square" style="max-width: 300px;"><div class="media-wrap"><span class="media-responsive" data-src="/photo/2015/0520/espnw_wwc_D_australiatopper_300x300.jpg" data-raw-width="300" data-raw-height="300" style="padding-bottom: 100%;" data-alt="Australia, Women's World Cup, Katrina Gorry" data-start-on-click="false"><noscript><img alt="Australia, Women's World Cup, Katrina Gorry" class="img-responsive" src="http://a1.espncdn.com/photo/2015/0520/espnw_wwc_D_australiatopper_300x300.jpg"></noscript></span></div><figcaption class="article-img-caption"><div class="article-img-source">Chris Hyde/Getty Images</div><p>Katrina Gorry is set to make her Women's World Cup debut for Australia.</p></figcaption></figure><p>As is the case with most games, set pieces will be an area to watch. The United States has looked vulnerable lately on the defensive side of dead-ball situations, showing an odd reluctance to attack the ball. That could prove fatal against a side that has its share of height through Heyman (5-11) and Emily van Egmond (5-10).</p><p>Plenty of eyes will be on the U.S. midfield, which struggled mightily in the final send-off game against South Korea. Holiday will need to be on the top of her game in order to stifle the attacking forays of Gorry. The hope for the United States is that Megan Rapinoe, who missed the South Korea game with a thigh injury, will provide the creativity along with Lloyd; that is assuming she isn't forced to help Klingenberg out too much defensively.</p><p>It remains to be seen <a href="/espnw/news-commentary/2015worldcup/article/13027378/jill-ellis-counting-loaded-us-front-line-lead-way-women-world-cup">which set of forwards</a> Ellis will utilize, but there figures to be plenty of pace regardless of whom she selects, with Abby Wambach in contention along with Leroux, Rodriguez and Press.</p><p>Another question that remains is the availability of Alex Morgan. The injured forward just recently returned to full training after spending the past seven weeks dealing with a bone bruise on her left knee. It's unlikely that she'll start, but she could come off the bench to run at a tired Australia defense.</p><p>"Obviously, we're going to look at what our needs are," Ellis said. "I'm excited now that Morgan is back in 100 percent training; looking great, sharp."</p><h2>Intangibles</h2><p>The U.S. women have never lost to Australia, compiling a record of 22-0-2. But nine players on Australia's roster have spent time playing professionally in the United States, so there will be no fear factor when the Matildas take the field.</p><p>For the Americans, there is considerable pressure on the team, even aside from Solo's legal entanglements. Nothing less than winning the tournament will do, but the Americans are well versed in dealing with such expectations, and have safely navigated their way through the group stage in the past.</p><h2>Which team will win?</h2><p>This is a highly experienced U.S. side that will take the field. Look for the U.S. women to prevail 3-0.</p><div class="footer-bump"><figcaption class="line author"><div class="contributor-details">Jeff Carlisle covers MLS and the U.S. national team for ESPN FC.</div></figcaption></div></div><section class="tri-feature outbrain-module"><h2 class="pillar-label">Sponsored Content</h2><div class="OUTBRAIN" data-src="http://espn.go.com/espnw/news-commentary/2015worldcup/article/13032955/how-does-australia-match-us-women-ahead-opener" data-widget-id="AR_1" data-ob-template="ESPNW" ></div></section><section class="tri-feature outbrain-module"><h2 class="pillar-label">Related Content</h2><div class="OUTBRAIN" data-src="http://espn.go.com/espnw/news-commentary/2015worldcup/article/13032955/how-does-australia-match-us-women-ahead-opener" data-widget-id="AR_2" data-ob-template="ESPNW" ></div></section><a name="comments"></a><div class="article-chat"><p class="legal-text">Use a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/r.php" rel="nofollow">Facebook account</a> to add a comment, subject to Facebook's <a href="https://www.facebook.com/policies/" rel="nofollow">Terms of Service</a> and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/about/privacy/" rel="nofollow">Privacy Policy</a>.

And despite having the gold medal around their necks at that tournament, the Americans still feel like they have some unfinished business. The penalty shootout defeat to Japan in the 2011 Women's World Cup final still sticks in the craw of the U.S. team, and it has been <a href=\"/espnw/news-commentary/2015worldcup/article/13008603/ending-drought-uswnt-learned-2011-world-cup-loss\">16 years since the Americans last hoisted the trophy</a>.</p><p>After a month of being cooped up in training camp, the energy in the U.S. squad is palpable as the Americans prepare to face Australia on Monday evening (7:30 p.m. ET).</p><p>\"I'm anxious,\" admitted U.S. defender Becky Sauerbrunn at Saturday's news conference. \"I need [the tournament] to start.\"</p><p>It won't be long until she gets her wish.</p><h2>What's on the line?</h2><alsosee><p>With the tournament now expanded to 24 teams, the first round has become much more forgiving. In addition to the top two finishers in each group progressing to the knockout stages, the four best third-place teams will also advance. A hiccup or a poor performance need not be fatal.</p><p>But there is considerable value in seizing control of Group D. Not only would a win give the victor a significant confidence boost, but also the distance traveled for the group winner is considerably less than that for the group runner-up. A victory on Monday would amount to a giant step toward making life easier in the knockout stages.</p><h2>Style and tactics</h2><p>Australia plays a proactive 4-3-3 that features the team pressing high up the field. But the Matildas are also capable of striking on the counter and exploiting the pace of forwards Lisa De Vanna, Michelle Heyman and Sam Kerr.</p><p>After tinkering with a variety of formations and personnel, U.S. manager Jill Ellis has settled upon a 4-4-2 formation that features outside backs Ali Krieger and Meghan Klingenberg pushing up into the attack. Ellis also wants to see her team be more dangerous in transition, the better to utilize the speed of forwards like Sydney Leroux, Amy Rodriguez and Christen Press.</p><h2>Players to watch</h2><p><b>For Australia:</b> De Vanna, Katrina Gorry, Clare Polkinghorne</p><p>De Vanna is a pest to opposing defenders, and also has the ability to pick out a defense-splitting pass. Gorry -- nicknamed \"Mini\" due to her 5-foot-1 frame -- has emerged as an attacking force able to create something out of nothing, and is the 2014 AFC Player of the Year. Polkinghorne provides a veteran presence in the back and will be counted on to keep the Matildas organized. But the center back has been dealing with a hamstring injury and her availability is in question.</p><p><b>For the United States:</b> Carli Lloyd, Lauren Holiday, Klingenberg</p><p>Lloyd's reputation as a player who <a href=\"/espnw/news-commentary/2015worldcup/article/13006977/how-getting-cut-helped-carli-lloyd-refocus-find-spot-us-women-national-team\">delivers in the clutch</a> is well deserved; she has twice scored the game winner in an Olympic final. She will be counted on to help orchestrate the U.S. attack. Holiday has been moved into more of a holding role over the past year with mixed results. In addition to bringing the ball out of the back, she'll need to make sure she gets her tackles in. Klingenberg is one of the most inexperienced players in the U.S. lineup, and she'll need to be mindful of when to get forward and when to hold.</p><h2>And then there's Hope</h2><!--photo1--><p>U.S. goalkeeper Hope Solo has by all appearances been a model citizen since being suspended from the team for 30 days back in January, when her husband, Jerramy Stevens, was charged with DUI while driving a U.S. Soccer van with Solo as a passenger. This was on top of the domestic violence charges that were filed and later dropped against Solo last year.</p><p>But ESPN.com <a href=\"/espnw/news-commentary/article/12976615/detailed-look-hope-solo-domestic-violence-case-includes-reports-being-belligerent-jail\">obtained documents</a> that contradict some of what Solo has been telling the public with regard to the domestic violence case, and the Kirkland, Washington, prosecutors have appealed to have the case reopened. Both Solo and the U.S. team have proved able to deal with such distractions in the past, but how both team and player deal with the attention this time will be worth noting going forward. For the moment, the approach of Ellis is to <a href=\"/espnw/news-commentary/article/13032812/us-women-national-team-supportive-hope-solo-amid-domestic-violence-case-eve-world-cup\">simply ignore the report</a> and the attention surrounding it.</p><p>\"Hope's been fantastic,\" Ellis said. \"That [case] was a long time ago. I'll be honest, we've moved on, and she's been a fantastic player and teammate. None of that has even resonated with us and I'm sure some of the players aren't even aware of it.\"</p><h2>What we can expect</h2><p>Look for Australia to test Klingenberg early and often through De Vanna, who at age 30 still possesses impressive speed. Fellow forwards Michelle Heyman and Kerr also pose similar problems. The United States can be thrown off its game by teams that press high, but the Matildas will need to be selective as to when they push up. Mexico tried a similar tactic against the U.S. women in a pre-World Cup friendly, and gave up repeated breakaways thanks to the timing and speed of Leroux.</p><!--photo2--><p>As is the case with most games, set pieces will be an area to watch. The United States has looked vulnerable lately on the defensive side of dead-ball situations, showing an odd reluctance to attack the ball. That could prove fatal against a side that has its share of height through Heyman (5-11) and Emily van Egmond (5-10).</p><p>Plenty of eyes will be on the U.S. midfield, which struggled mightily in the final send-off game against South Korea. Holiday will need to be on the top of her game in order to stifle the attacking forays of Gorry. The hope for the United States is that Megan Rapinoe, who missed the South Korea game with a thigh injury, will provide the creativity along with Lloyd; that is assuming she isn't forced to help Klingenberg out too much defensively.</p><p>It remains to be seen <a href=\"/espnw/news-commentary/2015worldcup/article/13027378/jill-ellis-counting-loaded-us-front-line-lead-way-women-world-cup\">which set of forwards</a> Ellis will utilize, but there figures to be plenty of pace regardless of whom she selects, with Abby Wambach in contention along with Leroux, Rodriguez and Press.</p><p>Another question that remains is the availability of Alex Morgan. The injured forward just recently returned to full training after spending the past seven weeks dealing with a bone bruise on her left knee. It's unlikely that she'll start, but she could come off the bench to run at a tired Australia defense.</p><p>\"Obviously, we're going to look at what our needs are,\" Ellis said. \"I'm excited now that Morgan is back in 100 percent training; looking great, sharp.\"</p><h2>Intangibles</h2><p>The U.S. women have never lost to Australia, compiling a record of 22-0-2. But nine players on Australia's roster have spent time playing professionally in the United States, so there will be no fear factor when the Matildas take the field.</p><p>For the Americans, there is considerable pressure on the team, even aside from Solo's legal entanglements. Nothing less than winning the tournament will do, but the Americans are well versed in dealing with such expectations, and have safely navigated their way through the group stage in the past.</p><h2>Which team will win?</h2><p>This is a highly experienced U.S. side that will take the field. Look for the U.S. women to prevail 3-0.</p>","sourceline":"espnW.com","keywords":["USWNT","soccer","World Cup","Abby Wambach","Alex Morgan","Sydney Leroux","Women's World Cup","2015 Women's World Cup","U.S. Soccer"],"storeLink":true,"noRoundImages":false,"ads":true,"photos":[{"id":13000412,"title":"Hope Solo","headline":"Hope Solo","description":"Hope Solo heads into the World Cup with 170 caps -- and once again mired in controversy.","date":1433724140,"beauty":{"width":300,"height":300,"src":"/photo/2015/0602/espnw_g_solo_usa_300x300.jpg","credit":"Buda Mendes/Getty Images","description":"Hope Solo heads into the World Cup with 170 caps -- and once again mired in controversy.","altTag":"Hope Solo"},"type":"photo","style":"article-img-right article-img-square"},{"id":12921802,"title":"Australia, Women's World Cup, Katrina Gorry","headline":"Australia, Women's World Cup, Katrina Gorry","description":"Katrina Gorry is set to make her Women's World Cup debut for Australia.","date":1433724014,"beauty":{"width":300,"height":300,"src":"/photo/2015/0520/espnw_wwc_D_australiatopper_300x300.jpg","credit":"Chris Hyde/Getty Images","description":"Katrina Gorry is set to make her Women's World Cup debut for Australia.","altTag":"Australia, Women's World Cup, Katrina Gorry"},"type":"photo","style":"article-img-right article-img-square"}],"related":[{"id":13027378,"headline":"Coach Ellis counting on loaded front line to lead U.S. women in World Cup","title":"Jill Ellis counting on loaded U.S. front line to lead way in Women's World Cup","description":"The U.S. front line is loaded with talent and depth.
