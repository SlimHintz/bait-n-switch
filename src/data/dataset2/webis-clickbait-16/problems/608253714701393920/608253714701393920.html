Four New Mothers After They Took This Drug. Is It For Real?","date":1433846700000,"timestamp":1434554564681,"body":"<p>In the months after their children were born, all four women plunged into severe, debilitating sadness. Antidepressant treatments didn&rsquo;t work. They were admitted to the hospital. The women&rsquo;s average score on a questionnaire called the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression was 26.5; severe depression starts at 24. Normally, experts say, their illness might have lasted years.\r\n\r\nThen each of the four was given an injection of an experimental epilepsy drug, SAGE-547, made by a tiny Cambridge, Mass., biotechnology firm called Sage Therapeutics. Within 60&nbsp;hours, their scores on the Hamilton Scale sank past seven &ndash; the boundary for having any depression at all &ndash; to an average score of 1.8. Their symptoms had basically disappeared.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;We feel this is a very strong signal, because it is a robust response,&rdquo; says Samantha Meltzer-Brody, director of the perinatal psychiatry program at the University of North Carolina Center for Women's Mood Disorders and lead investigator of the study. &ldquo;It looks very exciting,&rdquo; adds Dr. <a href='http://www.forbes.com/profile/adele/'>Adele</a> Viguera, a psychiatrist at the Cleveland Clinic who was not associated with the study. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s only four patients but what&rsquo;s exciting is that you can treat someone relatively quickly for post-partum depression.&rdquo;\r\n\r\nIn early morning pre-market trading, shares in Sage Therapeutics increased 20% to $90.\r\n\r\nBut two former presidents of the American Psychiatric Association warn that the results are still too early to trust. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s as preliminary as preliminary can be with human subjects,&rdquo; says Nada Stotland, a professor at Rush Medical College in Chicago.\r\n\r\nAdds Columbia-Presbyterian psychiatry chair Jeffrey Lieberman: &ldquo;The problem is it&rsquo;s such a small number of people. It&rsquo;s an interesting target and a plausible mechanism of action. At this point it&rsquo;s a theory with some anecdotal supporting evidence and you can&rsquo;t really say much more.&rdquo;\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_13158\" align=\"\" width=\"1897\"]<img class=\"size-large wp-image-13158\" src=\"http://blogs-images.forbes.com/matthewherper/files/2015/06/Jeff-Jonas-standing-e1433823405464-1897x1940.jpg\" alt=\"Sage Therapeutics CEO Jeff Jonas\"> Sage Therapeutics CEO Jeff Jonas[/caption]\r\n\r\nSage Therapeutics, however, does have more to say. The data are positive enough that the company is advancing SAGE-547 into a larger placebo controlled trial to see if the dramatic benefits hold up. It will also start testing another experimental drug, one of more than 700 related compounds the company has synthesized, as a depression treatment. The hope is that it can find a pill that could act as a new treatment for post-partum depression, which affects one mother in five, and other mental illnesses. This could be a staging drug for creating medicines for mental illness, an area Big Pharma has been abandoning.\r\n\r\nFor Sage&rsquo;s chief executive, Jeffrey Jonas, this is part of a larger project: figuring out how to develop psychiatric drugs in a new, less failure-prone way. Jonas is a psychiatrist &ndash; he trained at Harvard &ndash; who worked on psychiatric medicines at Upjohn, [entity display=\"Forest Laboratories\" type=\"organization\" subtype=\"company\" active=\"true\" key=\"forest-laboratories\" ticker=\"FRX\" exchange=\"NYSE\" natural_id=\"fred/company/1653\"]Forest Laboratories[/entity], and [entity display=\"Shire\" type=\"organization\" subtype=\"company\" active=\"true\" key=\"shire\" natural_id=\"fred/company/3891\"]Shire[/entity]. He&rsquo;s watched as a drug company exodus from the field, as big names like [entity display=\"GlaxoSmithKline\" type=\"organization\" subtype=\"company\" active=\"true\" key=\"glaxosmithkline\" natural_id=\"fred/company/1797\"]GlaxoSmithKline[/entity], [entity display=\"Bristol-Myers Squibb\" type=\"organization\" subtype=\"company\" active=\"true\" key=\"bristol-myers-squibb\" ticker=\"BMY\" exchange=\"NYSE\" natural_id=\"fred/company/696\"]Bristol-Myers Squibb[/entity], and AstraZeneca, fled and, according to the newsletter NeuroPerspective, the number of central nervous system drugs developed by big firms fell 50%.\r\n<!--donotpaginate-->\r\nSage&rsquo;s first drug, SAGE-547, has until now been aimed at epilepsy, and not just regular epilepsy, but a severe form called refractory status epilepticus. These are seizures that don&rsquo;t end. Patients are generally put in a medical coma in the hopes that, if their brains are allowed to rest, the seizures will stop. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn&rsquo;t. Take the below video, produced by Massachusetts General Hospital, of a man named Raj whose seizures kept him in a coma for five months. Doctors there gave him the drug, and after several days, he opened his eyes. He could follow commands.\r\n\r\n[youtubevid id=\"9iYpc3JU5tk\"]\r\n\r\nSAGE-547 is a hormone released by nerve cells that triggers receptors of the GABA system, the main inhibitory system in the brain. Jonas believes that drugs like it could have an effect well beyond epilepsy.\r\n\r\nMany drug companies, Jonas alleges, have become obsessed with thinking of the brain as if it were a tumor, which could be stopped if only you could understand the genetic mutations that cause its problems. In cancer, genetic mutations lead to the overgrowth of cells, and that is the disease. But the brain is different. A gene might leave a patient vulnerable to depression, but fixing that gene might not fix the depression, he argues. And it might not matter what caused the depression, either. Like a cough, it might always be treated the same way.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;It&rsquo;s like saying if I break my arm in a ski accident or in a car door, the treatment is not going to be any different,&rdquo; Jonas says. Figuring out a genetic cause is not the answer, he argues.\r\n\r\nInstead, Jonas takes another lesson from cancer drug development. One reason that cancer drugs have moved ahead so quickly is that researchers have found serious diseases in which they can quickly get dramatic, early results. That&rsquo;s what Jonas has done in severe epilepsy. Now we know SAGE-547 can have a dramatic effect on the brain. Now he&rsquo;s testing the same molecule in post-partum depression, and he ticks off a broad swath of other illnesses it might affect: &ldquo;Anxiety, suicidality, depressive mood,&rdquo; Jonas says. &ldquo;So we are now faced with a wealth of opportunity.&rdquo;\r\n\r\nFirst he has to prove that the early hint seen in these depressed mothers is real. No clinical trial had ever before tried using an injection to treat post-partum depression. Could having gotten the shot have led to a dramatic placebo effect? Stranger things have happened. Jonas doubts it, but admits that he needs a placebo-controlled trial to know for sure.\r\n\r\nAnd if it works, he doesn&rsquo;t even think Sage-547 will itself become a depression drug. Instead, he hopes to use information about blood levels of the drug to help pick another molecule from SAGE&rsquo;s chemical libraries &ndash; to, in his words, &ldquo;hone in on what we hope will be an ideal oral agent for this disorder.&rdquo; Ideally, it would be a pill, with few side effects. It could take years to get there.\r\n\r\nThere&rsquo;s a lot of work to be done. But at least Jonas has a drug &ndash; and a plan.\r\n\r\n<em><strong>Also on Forbes:</strong></em>\r\n\r\n[gallery2012]</p>","description":"VideoIn the months after their children were born, all four women plunged into severe, debilitating sadness.

Antidepressant treatments didn’t work. They were admitted to the hospital. The women’s average score on a questionnaire called the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression was 26.5; severe depression starts at 24. Normally, experts say, their illness might have lasted years.</p>\n<p>Then each of the four was given an injection of an experimental epilepsy drug, SAGE-547, made by a tiny Cambridge, Mass., biotechnology firm called Sage Therapeutics. Within 60&nbsp;hours, their scores on the Hamilton Scale sank past seven – the boundary for having any depression at all – to an average score of 1.8. Their symptoms had basically disappeared.</p>\n<p>“We feel this is a very strong signal, because it is a robust response,” says Samantha Meltzer-Brody, director of the perinatal psychiatry program at the University of North Carolina Center for Women’s Mood Disorders and lead investigator of the study. “It looks very exciting,” adds Dr. <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/profile/adele/\" target=\"_self\">Adele</a> Viguera, a psychiatrist at the Cleveland Clinic who was not associated with the study. “It’s only four patients but what’s exciting is that you can treat someone relatively quickly for post-partum depression.”</p>\n<p>In early morning pre-market trading, shares in Sage Therapeutics increased 20% to $90.</p>\n<p>But two former presidents of the American Psychiatric Association warn that the results are still too early to trust. “It’s as preliminary as preliminary can be with human subjects,” says Nada Stotland, a professor at Rush Medical College in Chicago.</p>\n<div id=\"inread\" article-ad-inbody=\"inread\" class=\"inread\"></div>\n<p>Adds Columbia-Presbyterian psychiatry chair Jeffrey Lieberman: “The problem is it’s such a small number of people. It’s an interesting target and a plausible mechanism of action. At this point it’s a theory with some anecdotal supporting evidence and you can’t really say much more.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_13158\"> \n <img class=\"size-large wp-image-13158\" src=\"http://blogs-images.forbes.com/matthewherper/files/2015/06/Jeff-Jonas-standing-e1433823405464-1897x1940.jpg\" alt=\"Sage Therapeutics CEO Jeff Jonas\" /> \n <p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Sage Therapeutics CEO Jeff Jonas</p> \n</div>\n<div class=\"vestpocket\" vest-pocket=\"\"></div>\n<p>Sage Therapeutics, however, does have more to say. The data are positive enough that the company is advancing SAGE-547 into a larger placebo controlled trial to see if the dramatic benefits hold up. It will also start testing another experimental drug, one of more than 700 related compounds the company has synthesized, as a depression treatment. The hope is that it can find a pill that could act as a new treatment for post-partum depression, which affects one mother in five, and other mental illnesses. This could be a staging drug for creating medicines for mental illness, an area Big Pharma has been abandoning.</p>\n<p>For Sage’s chief executive, Jeffrey Jonas, this is part of a larger project: figuring out how to develop psychiatric drugs in a new, less failure-prone way. Jonas is a psychiatrist – he trained at Harvard – who worked on psychiatric medicines at Upjohn, <span class=\"quotecard\" article-quote-card=\"\" data-ticker=\"FRX\" data-exchange=\"NYSE\" data-type=\"organization\" data-naturalid=\"fred/company/1653\" data-quotes-closing=\"0.0\" data-quotes-now=\"0.0\" data-link=\"/companies/forest-laboratories\" data-name=\"Forest Laboratories\"></span>, and <span class=\"quotecard\" article-quote-card=\"\" data-ticker=\"null\" data-exchange=\"null\" data-type=\"organization\" data-naturalid=\"fred/company/3891\" data-quotes-closing=\"0.0\" data-quotes-now=\"0.0\" data-link=\"/companies/shire\" data-name=\"Shire\"></span>.

These are seizures that don’t end. Patients are generally put in a medical coma in the hopes that, if their brains are allowed to rest, the seizures will stop. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn’t. Take the below video, produced by Massachusetts General Hospital, of a man named Raj whose seizures kept him in a coma for five months. Doctors there gave him the drug, and after several days, he opened his eyes. He could follow commands.</p>\n<div class=\"youtube-wrapper\"> \n <iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"485\" height=\"365\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/9iYpc3JU5tk\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe> \n</div>\n<p>SAGE-547 is a hormone released by nerve cells that triggers receptors of the GABA system, the main inhibitory system in the brain. Jonas believes that drugs like it could have an effect well beyond epilepsy.</p>\n<p>Many drug companies, Jonas alleges, have become obsessed with thinking of the brain as if it were a tumor, which could be stopped if only you could understand the genetic mutations that cause its problems. In cancer, genetic mutations lead to the overgrowth of cells, and that is the disease. But the brain is different. A gene might leave a patient vulnerable to depression, but fixing that gene might not fix the depression, he argues. And it might not matter what caused the depression, either. Like a cough, it might always be treated the same way.</p>\n<p>“It’s like saying if I break my arm in a ski accident or in a car door, the treatment is not going to be any different,” Jonas says. Figuring out a genetic cause is not the answer, he argues.</p>\n<p>Instead, Jonas takes another lesson from cancer drug development. One reason that cancer drugs have moved ahead so quickly is that researchers have found serious diseases in which they can quickly get dramatic, early results. That’s what Jonas has done in severe epilepsy. Now we know SAGE-547 can have a dramatic effect on the brain. Now he’s testing the same molecule in post-partum depression, and he ticks off a broad swath of other illnesses it might affect: “Anxiety, suicidality, depressive mood,” Jonas says. “So we are now faced with a wealth of opportunity.”</p>\n<p>First he has to prove that the early hint seen in these depressed mothers is real. No clinical trial had ever before tried using an injection to treat post-partum depression. Could having gotten the shot have led to a dramatic placebo effect? Stranger things have happened. Jonas doubts it, but admits that he needs a placebo-controlled trial to know for sure.</p>\n<p>And if it works, he doesn’t even think Sage-547 will itself become a depression drug. Instead, he hopes to use information about blood levels of the drug to help pick another molecule from SAGE’s chemical libraries – to, in his words, “hone in on what we hope will be an ideal oral agent for this disorder.” Ideally, it would be a pill, with few side effects. It could take years to get there.</p>\n<p>There’s a lot of work to be done.
