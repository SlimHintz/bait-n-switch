Freelancers","date":1433789160000,"timestamp":1433789200758,"body":"<p>[gallery2012]\r\n\r\nDo you have a full-time job with a 401(k) and health benefits? Don&rsquo;t count on it lasting until you&rsquo;re ready to retire. Increasingly companies are moving toward a contingent workforce. According to a 2010 <a href=\"http://http-download.intuit.com/http.intuit/CMO/intuit/futureofsmallbusiness/intuit_2020_report.pdf\">study</a> by tax preparation software firm Intuit, the share of U.S. workers who will be making a living as freelancers will balloon from less than a third to 40% by 2020.\r\n\r\nFinancial literacy website NerdWallet figured it was time to determine which cities are the best for contingent workers to live. The top city is a spot you&rsquo;d associate more with retirees than with freelance TV producers, web developers or writers: Scottsdale, AZ, where the sun shines 300 days a year and there are some 50 golf courses. But according to data NerdWallet pulled from the U.S. Census Bureau&rsquo;s 2013 American Community Survey, the compensation per household earning self-employment income in Scottsdale, at $66,300, is the highest of any of the 100 cities NerdWallet surveyed.\r\n\r\nTo put together its list of the <a href=\"http://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/cities/best-cities-freelance-workers-2015/\">top 20 cities for feelancers</a>, NerdWallet used self-employment income as 25% of the score. For another 25% it looked at the percentage of households that have self-employment income. In Scottsdale, that number is 12%. Since freelancers need to buy their own health insurance, it relied on the share of households with direct-purchase health insurance for 12.5% of the score, and the monthly cost of that insurance for another 21.5%. (Scottsdale&rsquo;s retiree population presumably skews the share of people with direct-purchase insurance higher.) Finally it looked at the median monthly rental cost for 25% of the score. In Scottsdale that number is $1,100.\r\n\r\nThe second-best city for freelancers is less of a surprise: Los Angeles, home to legions of people who aspire to make it as actors, producers, writers, composers and directors. Of all the cities NerdWallet evaluated, L.A. has the largest share of households with freelance income, at 19%. But the average income, at $35,500, is much lower than Scottsdale. That probably reflects the feast or famine nature of work for entertainment freelancers. Rent in L.A. is higher than any of the other 19 cities on the list, at $1,200.\r\n\r\nThe third city on the list, Portland, OR, comes as a surprise to me. But it seems that nearly 16% of the population derives income from freelance work and the self-employment income averages $32,200. The median monthly rent, at $960, is lower than in many cities. A quick search on job search site Flexjobs shows nearly 3,500 listings for telecommuting, flexible and part-time jobs, including a <a href=\"http://www.flexjobs.com/publicjobs/information-systems-business-analyst-2-383874\">part-time information systems business analyst job</a>, a <a href=\"http://www.flexjobs.com/publicjobs/accountant-ii-383817\">freelance accounting position</a> and a <a href=\"http://www.flexjobs.com/publicjobs/oag-architect-383411\">short-time freelance software architect post</a>.\r\n\r\nSee our slideshow above for the top ten cities and follow this <a href=\"http://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/cities/best-cities-freelance-workers-2015/\">link</a> to see NerdWallet&rsquo;s blog post and chart of the top 20.</p>","description":"Do you have a full-time job with a 401(k) and health benefits?

Before that I covered law and lawyers for journalistic stickler, harsh taskmaster and the best teacher a young reporter could have had, Steven Brill.","largeAvatar":"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/440613347274ca1dd817225238b83bab?s=136&amp;d=http%3A%2F%2F0.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2Fad516503a11cd5ca435acc9bb6523536%3Fs%3D136&amp;r=G","smallAvatar":"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/440613347274ca1dd817225238b83bab?s=40&amp;d=http%3A%2F%2F0.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2Fad516503a11cd5ca435acc9bb6523536%3Fs%3D40&amp;r=G","largestAvatar":"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/440613347274ca1dd817225238b83bab?s=400&amp;d=http%3A%2F%2F0.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2Fad516503a11cd5ca435acc9bb6523536%3Fs%3D400&amp;r=G","mediumAvatar":"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/440613347274ca1dd817225238b83bab?s=62&amp;d=http%3A%2F%2F0.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2Fad516503a11cd5ca435acc9bb6523536%3Fs%3D62&amp;r=G","largerAvatar":"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/440613347274ca1dd817225238b83bab?s=400&amp;d=http%3A%2F%2F0.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2Fad516503a11cd5ca435acc9bb6523536%3Fs%3D400&amp;r=G"},"topics":["leadership","careers","forbeswoman","lifestyle","politics","corporate-responsibility","business","managing","education","social-media","ceo-network","leaders","powering-productivity","tech"],"recentActivityCount":10,"latestActivityDate":1445688000000,"dailyActivityCount":0,"displayChannel":"leadership","displaySection":"susanadamsblog","shortUri":"http://onforb.es/12liQ4Z","slug":"susanadams","contributorSince":1280851464000,"showNoVestPocket":false,"embargo":false,"enableContribContact":false,"enableTwitterFeed":false,"disableCanonical":false,"disableDigest":false}],"channelSection":[{"channelId":"channel_6","sectionId":"section_37"},{"channelId":"channel_6","sectionId":"section_280"},{"channelId":"channel_6"}],"slug":"Getting Ahead","blogType":"individual","slides":[{"image":"/imageserve/5575cffae4b017853ece4c78/640x434.jpg?fit=scale&background=000000","uri":"/pictures/mkl45ejikk/1-scottsdale-az","shortUri":"http://onforb.es/1IyPgRE","caption":"<p>Income per household earning self-employment income: $66,300</p><p>Percentage of households with self-employment income: 12%</p><p>Median rent: $1,100<br/></p>","title":"1.

Don’t count on it lasting until you’re ready to retire. Increasingly companies are moving toward a contingent workforce. According to a 2010 <a href=\"http://http-download.intuit.com/http.intuit/CMO/intuit/futureofsmallbusiness/intuit_2020_report.pdf\">study</a> by tax preparation software firm Intuit, the share of U.S. workers who will be making a living as freelancers will balloon from less than a third to 40% by 2020.</p>\n<p>Financial literacy website NerdWallet figured it was time to determine which cities are the best for contingent workers to live. The top city is a spot you’d associate more with retirees than with freelance TV producers, web developers or writers: Scottsdale, AZ, where the sun shines 300 days a year and there are some 50 golf courses. But according to data NerdWallet pulled from the U.S. Census Bureau’s 2013 American Community Survey, the compensation per household earning self-employment income in Scottsdale, at $66,300, is the highest of any of the 100 cities NerdWallet surveyed.</p>\n<p>To put together its list of the <a href=\"http://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/cities/best-cities-freelance-workers-2015/\">top 20 cities for feelancers</a>, NerdWallet used self-employment income as 25% of the score. For another 25% it looked at the percentage of households that have self-employment income. In Scottsdale, that number is 12%. Since freelancers need to buy their own health insurance, it relied on the share of households with direct-purchase health insurance for 12.5% of the score, and the monthly cost of that insurance for another 21.5%. (Scottsdale’s retiree population presumably skews the share of people with direct-purchase insurance higher.) Finally it looked at the median monthly rental cost for 25% of the score. In Scottsdale that number is $1,100.</p>\n<div id=\"inread\" article-ad-inbody=\"inread\" class=\"inread\"></div>\n<p>The second-best city for freelancers is less of a surprise: Los Angeles, home to legions of people who aspire to make it as actors, producers, writers, composers and directors. Of all the cities NerdWallet evaluated, L.A. has the largest share of households with freelance income, at 19%. But the average income, at $35,500, is much lower than Scottsdale. That probably reflects the feast or famine nature of work for entertainment freelancers. Rent in L.A. is higher than any of the other 19 cities on the list, at $1,200.</p>\n<p>The third city on the list, Portland, OR, comes as a surprise to me. But it seems that nearly 16% of the population derives income from freelance work and the self-employment income averages $32,200. The median monthly rent, at $960, is lower than in many cities. A quick search on job search site Flexjobs shows nearly 3,500 listings for telecommuting, flexible and part-time jobs, including a <a href=\"http://www.flexjobs.com/publicjobs/information-systems-business-analyst-2-383874\">part-time information systems business analyst job</a>, a <a href=\"http://www.flexjobs.com/publicjobs/accountant-ii-383817\">freelance accounting position</a> and a <a href=\"http://www.flexjobs.com/publicjobs/oag-architect-383411\">short-time freelance software architect post</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"vestpocket\" vest-pocket=\"\"></div>\n<p>See our slideshow above for the top ten cities and follow this <a href=\"http://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/cities/best-cities-freelance-workers-2015/\">link</a> to see NerdWallet’s blog post and chart of the top 20.</p>"],"galleryId":"5575cf5ee4b017853ece4c77","disableDigest":false,"writtenByForbesStaff":true,"channelSectionMappings":[{"id":"channel_6","channelName":"Leadership","url":"/leadership"},{"id":"channel_6section_280","channelName":"Leadership","sectionName":"Win At Work","url":"/ebooks/win-at-work/"},{"id":"channel_6section_37","channelName":"Leadership","sectionName":"Careers","url":"/careers"}],"individualAuthor":{"naturalId":"blogAuthorId/blog/author/250","name":"Susan Adams","avatars":[{"size":40,"image":"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/440613347274ca1dd817225238b83bab?s=40&amp;d=http%3A%2F%2F0.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2Fad516503a11cd5ca435acc9bb6523536%3Fs%3D40&amp;r=G"},{"size":62,"image":"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/440613347274ca1dd817225238b83bab?s=62&amp;d=http%3A%2F%2F0.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2Fad516503a11cd5ca435acc9bb6523536%3Fs%3D62&amp;r=G"},{"size":136,"image":"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/440613347274ca1dd817225238b83bab?s=136&amp;d=http%3A%2F%2F0.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2Fad516503a11cd5ca435acc9bb6523536%3Fs%3D136&amp;r=G"},{"size":400,"image":"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/440613347274ca1dd817225238b83bab?s=400&amp;d=http%3A%2F%2F0.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2Fad516503a11cd5ca435acc9bb6523536%3Fs%3D400&amp;r=G"}],"url":"http://www.forbes.com/sites/susanadams/","type":"Forbes Staff","profileUrl":"/sites/susanadams/","twitterName":"susanadamsnyc","authorType":"individual","email":"sadams@forbes.com","blog":false,"numFollowers":0,"shortBio":"I cover careers, jobs and every aspect of leadership.","timestamp":1445787600351,"description":"Since Forbes hired me in 1995 to write a legal column, I’ve taken advantage of the great freedom the magazine grants its staff, to pursue stories about everything from books to billionaires. I’ve chased South Africa’s first black billionaire through a Cape Town shopping mall while admirers flocked around him, climbed inside the hidden chamber in the home of an antiquarian arms and armor dealer atop San Francisco’s Telegraph Hill, and sipped Chateau Latour with one of Picasso’s grandsons in the Venice art museum of French tycoon François Pinault. I’ve edited the magazine’s Lifestyle section and opinion pieces by the likes of John Bogle and Gordon Bethune.

I’ve chased South Africa’s first black billionaire through a Cape Town shopping mall while admirers flocked around him, climbed inside the hidden chamber in the home of an antiquarian arms and armor dealer atop San Francisco’s Telegraph Hill, and sipped Chateau Latour with one of Picasso’s grandsons in the Venice art museum of French tycoon François Pinault. I’ve edited the magazine’s Lifestyle section and opinion pieces by the likes of John Bogle and Gordon Bethune. As deputy leadership editor, these days I mostly write about careers and corporate social responsibility. I got my job at Forbes through a brilliant libertarian economist, Susan Lee, whom I used to put on television at MacNeil/Lehrer NewsHour.
