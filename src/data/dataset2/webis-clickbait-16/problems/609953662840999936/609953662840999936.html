Mistakes You Can't Afford To Make","date":1434050400000,"timestamp":1437846448737,"body":"<p>Ideas make or break businesses. While execution is critical, what matters most is <em>what</em> your organization is actually executing. New ideas make the difference between organizational growth and stagnation. Virtually all leaders say they champion new ideas and creative thinking. But do your actions as a leader consciously encourage the creation and open flow of new ideas - or unconsciously suppress them?\r\n\r\nWe often hear about the importance of <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/sap/2013/01/30/what-is-thought-leadership-5-steps-to-get-it-right/\">thought leadership</a>, which of course generally involves becoming a respected authority in one's field. But what about the importance of carefully <em>growing</em> ideas 0f real business value? I&rsquo;d call this &ldquo;idea <a href='http://www.forbes.com/leadership/'>leadership</a>\" &ndash; the care and feeding of new ideas within an organization.&nbsp; It can be a delicate business; new flowers wilt easily. Accordingly, here are five&nbsp;idea-related leadership mistakes you can't afford to make.\r\n\r\n<strong>Operating on the assumption you're the smartest person in the room</strong> - It's possible you are - but best not to think that way or show it. The best leaders are secure enough to not be threatened by high intelligence. They want to create an environment where smart creative people are never afraid to float a new idea - even a seemingly wild or improbable one.\r\n\r\n<strong>Forgetting that <a href='http://www.forbes.com/ebooks/warren-buffett-59-billion-philanthropist/'>Warren Buffett</a> has been called the \"Delegator in Chief\"</strong> - A second cousin of the point above.&nbsp; Warren Buffett has long been known for surrounding himself with very best and brightest people and giving them wide latitude to work - so much so that he's been called the <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/24/weekinreview/24buffett.html\">Delegator in Chief</a>. Chronically holding on to too much because you don't feel anyone else can do it as well as you is nothing but the classic recipe for executive burnout. &nbsp;If as brilliant a business leader as Warren Buffett is willing to let go and listen carefully to the best thinking of others, there's no reason you can't too.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_fe07f5ebebfb4ac1bb8a648cbf34c823\" align=\"\" width=\"640\"]<img class=\"dam-image ap size-large wp-image-fe07f5ebebfb4ac1bb8a648cbf34c823\" src=\"http://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/fe07f5ebebfb4ac1bb8a648cbf34c823/640x0.jpg?fit=scale\" alt=\"\"> Credit: AP Photo/Nati Harnik[/caption]\r\n\r\n<strong>Surrounding yourself with people who only agree with your ideas</strong> - Tempting but never smart. Large corporations can be a very nervous place. Groupthink flourishes when people are fearful of presenting a dissenting view, afraid of losing a job or bonus. Meetings full of \"yes men\" and \"yes women\" may be pleasant and conflict-free, but they lack creative dynamism. &nbsp; The best leaders build a fear-free environment where thoughtful opposition is welcomed.\r\n\r\n<strong>Shooting down an idea because \"it wasn't invented here&rdquo;</strong> - Idea incubation is no place for ego. I can't tell you how many times (as I can no longer remember them all) over the course of my career that effective advertising and marketing campaigns would be jettisoned when a new CEO or CMO came aboard - simply because a campaign was the brainchild of the prior regime. Just as a rising tide lifts all boats, a single powerful idea can lift an entire organization. Strong leaders nurture strong ideas - regardless of their origin.\r\n\r\n<strong>Not spending enough time listening to the ideas of supervisors and middle management</strong> &ndash; If you&rsquo;re in senior management, the lower managerial levels are, after all, closer to the actual work than you are, closer to operational processes, and closer to the employees and their grassroots concerns. Valuable insights can be gained at all levels. It always surprised me when I was in management in the corporate world, how relatively neglected the lower ranks of management were, even though large numbers of experienced, thoughtful, capable people were working there. The most insightful leaders circulate and listen widely, and take fine ideas wherever they find them.\r\n\r\nHierarchy and ego are the enemy of idea generation.&nbsp; The best leaders recognize that the best ideas come from smart insightful people, and want to surround themselves with them, wherever they might reside.\r\n\r\n*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *\r\n\r\n<em>Victor is author of&nbsp; <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/The-Type-Manager-Leading-Successfully/dp/0735205434\">The Type B Manager: Leading Successfully in a Type A World</a> (Prentice Hall Press).</em><strong>\r\n</strong>\r\n\r\n<em><strong>Also on Forbes:</strong></em>\r\n\r\n[gallery2012]\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<!--donotpaginate--></p>","description":"Virtually all leaders say they champion the development of new ideas.

Autodesk, the world&#39;s biggest seller of design and engineering software, needed a futurist to help it figure out which way the astrolabe is pointing. Brandt, 36, got his bachelor's degree in architecture from the University of Kansas and worked a few jobs as a design engineer, including a stint at Boeing, before receiving a Ph.D. in building technology from Harvard in 2008. Shortly afterward with his schoolmate Ivan Panushev, he started a company called Horizontal Systems in New York City that created one of the first cloud-based applications for computing and modeling building design. Autodesk bought the company in December 2011 and Brandt has been with Autodesk ever since. Now it's his job to communicate back to the product teams at Autodesk all that's promising at the forefront of manufacturing, construction, materials science, and computer-aided design.<br />One futuristic trend he's following is computational materials, or substances designed by a computer to have the superior properties required by engineers. The software figures out the materials' recipe based on rules entered into the computer by the humans. The same approach of letting the machine figure it out can be applied to the design of chairs, buildings and bridges. \"You can design anything without knowing what it's supposed to look like,\" says Brandt.<br />Brandt is a huge proponent of 3D printing, but not as a consumer play. \"It's not a startup game. The real benefits will go industrial manufacturing firms,\" says Brandt. Companies he's following are seeing big increases in productivity by printing the injection molds rather than the parts themselves. His contacts at Oak Ridge National Labs are even printing an entire car. One of his favorite programs at Autodesk is Spark, an open software platform that will make it easier for manufacturers, software developers, scientists and designers to connect any file to any 3D printer, similar to how Adobe's Postscript software standardized desktop publishing for the masses.<br />&nbsp;</p>","title":"Jordan Brandt, Technology Futurist, Autodesk","position":0,"imageId":"55352925e4b0bacdbd747aed","galleryId":"54f4e701da47a54de82442d4","height":2620,"width":3945,"slug":"jordan-brandt-technology"},{"image":"/imageserve/984b7751ae4e581a25da054e8a4372f0/640x434.jpg?fit=scale&background=000000","uri":"/pictures/fdjh45midh/david-limp-senior-vice-p","shortUri":"http://onforb.es/1dznnvd","caption":"<p>For a company that increased its research and development spending for at least the last 17 quarters, Amazon has a fairly vanilla innovative process. All ideas go through the same refinement cycle, according to Senior Vice President of devices David Limp, eventually leading to a six-page &ldquo;press release&rdquo; that reads as if a product was being launched that day. A meeting would be scheduled to over that document, and CEO Jeff Bezos and his executive team would take about 30 minutes to read and digest the information, which should be focused on why a customer needs the new product. &ldquo;It feels a bit like study hall,&rdquo; says Limp. Though boring, Amazon&rsquo;s approach to new devices has been highly effective, leading to products like media player Fire TV and the company&rsquo;s first smartphone, the Fire Phone, in the last year, Limp oversaw the development of both products, the latter of which took four years to bring to fruition. That was longer than expected says Limp, who noted that it took years to get features like 3D display images (dubbed &ldquo;Dynamic Perspective&rdquo;) suitable for public use. After stints at Apple and Palm, Limp joined Amazon right around the time it started to explore the possibility of a smartphone, but initially was pegged to lead the company&rsquo;s education efforts. Limp never thought he&#39;s be where he is now, nor did he think the company would be where it&rsquo;s at now: &ldquo;If you had gone back and done a survey of the average hundred pundits seven or eight years ago and asked who would lead device and cloud computing companies, Amazon wouldn&rsquo;t be on that list.&rdquo;</p>","title":"David Limp, Senior Vice President of Devices, Amazon","position":3,"imageId":"984b7751ae4e581a25da054e8a4372f0","galleryId":"54f4e701da47a54de82442d4","height":1073,"width":1905,"slug":"david-limp-senior-vice-p"},{"image":"/imageserve/6f1b321bec24380b02bd1e0f251e0fa4/640x434.jpg?fit=scale&background=000000","uri":"/pictures/fdjh45midh/krisztian-flautner-vp-of","shortUri":"http://onforb.es/1dznnvf","caption":"<p>ARM is going tiny as it takes a leading role in powering the Internet of Things.

What customers and merchants want, says Lyons, are easier, faster and safer transactions. Delivering on that promise at MasterCard&rsquo;s scale is no easy task. The 50-year-old payment network takes care of two billion cards accepted at 37 million locations in 210 countries and 150 currencies. That&#39;s a scale no startup can match, but it was his startup savvy that got Lyons his current role. He came to MasterCard in 2009 as part of its $100 million acquisition of Orbiscom, a fast-growing Irish firm Lyons was running that pioneered virtual, temporary card numbers. Lyons was tapped the next year by MasterCard CEO Ajay Banga to kick start its global innovation program. &quot;He said to me, &#39;It&#39;s your role to look at the future with a fresh perspective. Don&#39;t worry about the way things are done today. Take some risks and see what works.&#39;&quot; Over the past three years MasterCard has created a flurry of innovation programs and more than 250 prototypes. &quot;The idea is to fail smart: move fast and cheap and learn as much as possible,&quot; says Lyons. One program, Innovation Express, forces employees to come up with a market-ready product or service in 48 hours, complete with a promotional video. Two examples now on the market: Simplify.com, an email-based invoicing service for small businesses, and ShopThis, a pop-up window feature that lets you purchase goods directly and easily from any publisher&#39;s website. Another idea contest, called Involve, got ten percent of the company, or 800 people, competing with ideas worth $50 million to $100 million in revenue potential. Three hundred teams were winnowed down to 6 in three elimination rounds. The finalists had to present via live webcast to the entire company for voting. Winners and cash prizes will be announced this fall. MasterCard is so confident in its new-idea process that it now offers &quot;labs-as-a-service&quot; to customers in the form of MC Advisors.

Now with 7,000 employees, Reynauld considers maintaining Iliad&rsquo;s flat organizational structure a priority: &ldquo;This enables Iliad to concentrate on the essentials and to strip out all the unnecessary costs: not much is outsourced and we rely on highly operational directors and managers.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>(Photo credit:&nbsp;ERIC PIERMONT/AFP/Getty Images)</p>","title":"Thomas Reynaud, Deputy Chief Financial Officer, Iliad","position":12,"credit":"ERIC PIERMONT/AFP/Getty Images","imageId":"c37749c1d3e901a1b09bc8e39df24f0f","galleryId":"54f4e701da47a54de82442d4","height":4256,"width":2832,"slug":"thomas-reynaud-deputy-ch"}],"sitePage":"forbes.com/leadership/blogs/victorlipman/index.html","displayChannel":"leadership","displaySection":"leadership","relatedContentList":[{"uri":"http://www.forbes.com/sites/stratfor/2015/02/25/the-wager-behind-the-european-debt-crisis/","title":"The Wager Behind the European Debt Crisis"},{"uri":"http://www.forbes.com/sites/drewhendricks/2013/11/08/handling-a-reputation-crisis-ways-an-entrepreneur-can-handle-social-media-posts/","title":"Handling A Reputation Crisis: Ways An Entrepreneur Can Handle Social Media Posts"}],"primaryChannelId":"channel_6","vestPocketList":[{"id":"5135f87476e4f6b6d9d4dfa5","naturalId":"blogAndPostId/blog/post/2064-3668","type":"blog","uri":"http://www.forbes.com/sites/victorlipman/2013/03/18/5-easy-ways-to-motivate-and-demotivate-employees/","image":"http://blogs-images.forbes.com/thumbnails/blog_2064/pt_2064_3668_o.jpg?t=1373298664","imageExists":false,"title":"5 Easy Ways To Motivate - And Demotivate - Employees","contentType":"blog","position":0,"authorName":"Victor Lipman","authorImage":"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/d149ddee18e82ee2c06d2ee58fa1d425?s=40&amp;d=http%3A%2F%2F1.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2Fad516503a11cd5ca435acc9bb6523536%3Fs%3D40&amp;r=G","authorUrl":"http://www.forbes.com/sites/victorlipman/","authorType":"Contributor"},{"id":"5106f38b76e4d24cddcdd7f5","naturalId":"blogAndPostId/blog/post/2064-3306","type":"blog","uri":"http://www.forbes.com/sites/victorlipman/2013/01/29/why-development-planning-is-important-neglected-and-can-cost-you-young-talent/","image":"http://blogs-images.forbes.com/thumbnails/blog_2064/pt_2064_3306_o.jpg?t=1373560578","imageExists":false,"title":"Why Employee Development Is Important, Neglected And Can Cost You Talent","contentType":"blog","position":1,"authorName":"Victor Lipman","authorImage":"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/d149ddee18e82ee2c06d2ee58fa1d425?s=40&amp;d=http%3A%2F%2F1.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2Fad516503a11cd5ca435acc9bb6523536%3Fs%3D40&amp;r=G","authorUrl":"http://www.forbes.com/sites/victorlipman/","authorType":"Contributor"},{"naturalId":"blogAndSlideId/blog/slide/3609-654","type":"slide","uri":"http://www.forbes.com/pictures/gjdm45jih/youtube-millionaires/","image":"http://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/561d3341e4b0ffa7afe5c904/","imageExists":false,"title":"The World's Top-Earning YouTube Stars 2015","count":89505,"reason":"MP-G"},{"naturalId":"blogAndPostId/blog/post/2943-1966","type":"blog","uri":"http://www.forbes.com/sites/francescoppola/2015/10/24/the-portuguese-presidents-decision-shows-the-eu-is-becoming-like-the-soviet-union/","image":"http://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/185180123/640x0.jpg?fit=scale","imageExists":false,"title":"The Fallout From The Greek Crisis Threatens European Democracy","count":0,"reason":"FB"},{"naturalId":"blogAndSlideId/blog/slide/989-28968","type":"slide","uri":"http://www.forbes.com/pictures/mlm45flmjl/the-forbes-fab-40-the-wo/","image":"http://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/561beba7e4b0ffa7afe5be30/","imageExists":false,"title":"The Forbes Fab 40: The World's Most Valuable Sports Brands 2015","count":51762,"reason":"MP-G"}],"vestPocketPosition":3,"newsKeywords":["Careers","ForbesWoman","Insights","Leadership","Managing","Leadership At The Top"],"manualDescription":"Virtually all leaders say they champion the development of new ideas.

While execution is critical, what matters most is <em>what</em> your organization is actually executing. New ideas make the difference between organizational growth and stagnation. Virtually all leaders say they champion new ideas and creative thinking. But do your actions as a leader consciously encourage the creation and open flow of new ideas – or unconsciously suppress them?</p>\n<p>We often hear about the importance of <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/sap/2013/01/30/what-is-thought-leadership-5-steps-to-get-it-right/\" target=\"_self\">thought leadership</a>, which of course generally involves becoming a respected authority in one’s field. But what about the importance of carefully <em>growing</em> ideas 0f real business value? I’d call this “idea <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/leadership/\" target=\"_self\">leadership</a>” – the care and feeding of new ideas within an organization.&nbsp; It can be a delicate business; new flowers wilt easily. Accordingly, here are five&nbsp;idea-related leadership mistakes you can’t afford to make.</p>\n<p><strong>Operating on the assumption you’re the smartest person in the room</strong> – It’s possible you are – but best not to think that way or show it. The best leaders are secure enough to not be threatened by high intelligence. They want to create an environment where smart creative people are never afraid to float a new idea – even a seemingly wild or improbable one.</p>\n<div class=\"vestpocket\" vest-pocket=\"\"></div>\n<p><strong>Forgetting that <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/ebooks/warren-buffett-59-billion-philanthropist/\" target=\"_self\">Warren Buffett</a> has been called the “Delegator in Chief”</strong> – A second cousin of the point above.&nbsp; Warren Buffett has long been known for surrounding himself with very best and brightest people and giving them wide latitude to work – so much so that he’s been called the <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/24/weekinreview/24buffett.html\">Delegator in Chief</a>. Chronically holding on to too much because you don’t feel anyone else can do it as well as you is nothing but the classic recipe for executive burnout. &nbsp;If as brilliant a business leader as Warren Buffett is willing to let go and listen carefully to the best thinking of others, there’s no reason you can’t too.</p>\n<div id=\"inread\" article-ad-inbody=\"inread\" class=\"inread\"></div>\n<div id=\"attachment_fe07f5ebebfb4ac1bb8a648cbf34c823\"> \n <img class=\"dam-image ap size-large wp-image-fe07f5ebebfb4ac1bb8a648cbf34c823\" src=\"http://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/fe07f5ebebfb4ac1bb8a648cbf34c823/640x0.jpg?fit=scale\" alt=\"\" /> \n <p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Credit: AP Photo/Nati Harnik</p> \n</div>\n<p><strong>Surrounding yourself with people who only agree with your ideas</strong> – Tempting but never smart. Large corporations can be a very nervous place. Groupthink flourishes when people are fearful of presenting a dissenting view, afraid of losing a job or bonus. Meetings full of “yes men” and “yes women” may be pleasant and conflict-free, but they lack creative dynamism. &nbsp; The best leaders build a fear-free environment where thoughtful opposition is welcomed.</p>\n<p><strong>Shooting down an idea because “it wasn’t invented here”</strong> – Idea incubation is no place for ego. I can’t tell you how many times (as I can no longer remember them all) over the course of my career that effective advertising and marketing campaigns would be jettisoned when a new CEO or CMO came aboard – simply because a campaign was the brainchild of the prior regime. Just as a rising tide lifts all boats, a single powerful idea can lift an entire organization. Strong leaders nurture strong ideas – regardless of their origin.</p>\n<p><strong>Not spending enough time listening to the ideas of supervisors and middle management</strong> – If you’re in senior management, the lower managerial levels are, after all, closer to the actual work than you are, closer to operational processes, and closer to the employees and their grassroots concerns. Valuable insights can be gained at all levels. It always surprised me when I was in management in the corporate world, how relatively neglected the lower ranks of management were, even though large numbers of experienced, thoughtful, capable people were working there. The most insightful leaders circulate and listen widely, and take fine ideas wherever they find them.</p>\n<p>Hierarchy and ego are the enemy of idea generation.&nbsp; The best leaders recognize that the best ideas come from smart insightful people, and want to surround themselves with them, wherever they might reside.</p>\n<p>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *</p>\n<p><em>Victor is author of&nbsp; <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/The-Type-Manager-Leading-Successfully/dp/0735205434\">The Type B Manager: Leading Successfully in a Type A World</a> (Prentice Hall Press).</em><strong></strong></p>\n<strong> </strong>\n<p><strong></strong></p>\n<p><em><strong>Also on Forbes:</strong></em></p>\n<div class=\"article-gallery-embedded\" data-url=\"http://www.forbes.com/pictures/fdjh45midh/next-gen-innovators/\"> \n <div class=\"embedded-content clearfix\"> \n  <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/pictures/fdjh45midh/next-gen-innovators/\" class=\"clearfix\" target=\"_self\"> \n   <div class=\"article-image-box\"> \n    <!--start:main_image--> \n    <img src=\"http://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/36cf4482c3814ab9d49ebbf777ef9371/400x400.jpg?fit=scale&amp;background=000000\" alt=\"\" /> \n    <!--end:main_image--> \n   </div> \n   <div class=\"article-text-box\"> \n    <header> \n     <i class=\"icon icon-gallery\"></i>Gallery \n    </header> \n    <h4>Next Gen Innovators 2014</h4> \n    <div class=\"article-launch-gallery\"> \n     <span class=\"article-launch-text\">Launch Gallery</span> \n     <div class=\"article-slide-count\">\n       13 images \n     </div> \n    </div> \n    <button class=\"article-launch-button\"><i class=\"icon icon-chevron-right\"></i></button> \n   </div></a> \n </div> \n</div>"],"galleryId":"54f4e701da47a54de82442d4","disableDigest":false,"writtenByForbesStaff":false,"channelSectionMappings":[{"id":"channel_6","channelName":"Leadership","url":"/leadership"},{"id":"channel_6section_119","channelName":"Leadership","sectionName":"Forbes Insights","url":"/insights"},{"id":"channel_6section_280","channelName":"Leadership","sectionName":"Win At Work","url":"/ebooks/win-at-work/"},{"id":"channel_6section_37","channelName":"Leadership","sectionName":"Careers","url":"/careers"},{"id":"channel_6section_40","channelName":"Leadership","sectionName":"Managing","url":"/managing"},{"id":"channel_6section_43","channelName":"Leadership","sectionName":"ForbesWoman","url":"/forbeswoman"}],"groupAuthor":{"naturalId":"blogAuthorId/blog/author/blog-2064","name":"Management Matters","avatars":[{"size":0},{"size":0},{"size":0},{"size":0}],"url":"http://www.forbes.com/sites/victorlipman/","profileUrl":"http://blogs.forbes.com/victorlipman/profile/","twitterName":"victorlipman1","authorType":"individual","blog":true,"numFollowers":0,"timestamp":1445787741281,"specialSlot":"ceo-network","primaryBlogNaturalId":"blogAuthorId/blog/author/blog-2064","primaryContributor":"blogAuthorId/blog/author/272156","primaryContributorData":{"naturalId":"blogAuthorId/blog/author/272156","name":"Victor Lipman","avatars":[{"size":40,"image":"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/d149ddee18e82ee2c06d2ee58fa1d425?s=40&amp;d=http%3A%2F%2F1.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2Fad516503a11cd5ca435acc9bb6523536%3Fs%3D40&amp;r=G"},{"size":62,"image":"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/d149ddee18e82ee2c06d2ee58fa1d425?s=62&amp;d=http%3A%2F%2F1.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2Fad516503a11cd5ca435acc9bb6523536%3Fs%3D62&amp;r=G"},{"size":136,"image":"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/d149ddee18e82ee2c06d2ee58fa1d425?s=136&amp;d=http%3A%2F%2F1.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2Fad516503a11cd5ca435acc9bb6523536%3Fs%3D136&amp;r=G"},{"size":400,"image":"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/d149ddee18e82ee2c06d2ee58fa1d425?s=400&amp;d=http%3A%2F%2F1.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2Fad516503a11cd5ca435acc9bb6523536%3Fs%3D400&amp;r=G"}],"blog":false,"numFollowers":0,"shortBio":"I write about management in its many forms.","description":"Author of \"The Type B Manager: Leading Successfully in a Type A World\" (Prentice Hall Press).
