Multi-Billionaire Vladimir Potanin Could Be In For $7B Divorce","date":1433871900000,"timestamp":1433876378025,"body":"<p>As the world&rsquo;s billionaires begin to concentrate an even larger share of global wealth, it&rsquo;s not only the value of art and luxury real estate that has exploded to the upside. Natalia Potanina, the ex-wife of Russia&rsquo;s richest man, is looking for half of <a href='http://www.forbes.com/profile/vladimir-potanin/'>Vladimir Potanin</a>&rsquo;s more than $14 billion fortune in what would be the world's most expensive divorce. Potanin, an oligarch close to the Kremlin, built his fortune on the back of metals giant [entity display=\"Norilsk Nickel\" type=\"organization\" subtype=\"company\" active=\"true\" activated=\"true\" deactivated=\"false\" key=\"norilsk-nickel\" natural_id=\"fred/company/3145\"]Norilsk Nickel[/entity], along with a diversified set of investments under holding company Interros, which until 2007 he jointly-owned with Brooklyn Nets-owner <a href='http://www.forbes.com/profile/mikhail-prokhorov/'>Mikhail Prokhorov</a>.\r\n\r\nPotanin followed the traditional Russian oligarch playbook on his way to the top. A former employee of the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations for the USSR, he met Prokhorov in 1991 when he was a manager at the <a href='http://www.forbes.com/international/'>International</a> Bank of Economic Cooperation (IBEC). By 1993, after the Iron Curtain had fallen, Potanin and Prokhorov teamed up to form Uneximbank, luring clients away from IBEC.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_160807014\" align=\"\" width=\"640\"]<img class=\"dam-image getty size-large wp-image-160807014\" src=\"http://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/160807014/640x0.jpg?fit=scale\" alt=\"\"> Vladimir Putin listens to Potanin during the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi -&nbsp;(Photo credit should read IVAN SEKRETAREV/AFP/Getty Images)[/caption]\r\n\r\nTheir big break came two years later when they gained control of metals giant Norilsk Nickel, along with oil firm Sidanco, in the controversial &ldquo;loans-for-shares&rdquo; privatizations auctions. Through <a href=\"http://www.interros.ru/en/company/history/\">Interros</a>, a&nbsp;holding company controlled by Potanin and Prokhorov, they expanded into several sectors of the Russian economy, from banking and finance, through commodities and precious metals, and even into media and journalism.\r\n\r\nIn terms of net worth, Potanin&rsquo;s rise was only as spectacular as his first fall. He first made his way into the ten digit club in 1998, when we valued him at $1.6 billion. By our 2008 billionaires list, Potanin was the world&rsquo;s 25th richest man with a fortune of $19.3 billion. As the global financial crisis unfolded, though, he was forced to offload assets, selling stakes in [entity display=\"Polyus Gold\" type=\"organization\" subtype=\"company\" active=\"true\" activated=\"true\" deactivated=\"false\" key=\"polyus-gold\" ticker=\"OPYGY\" exchange=\"MICEX\" natural_id=\"fred/company/3431\"]Polyus Gold[/entity] and Prof-Media, the country&rsquo;s largest media group. His net worth shrunk by a staggering $17.2 billion to $2.1 billion by our 2009 global billionaires issue.\r\n\r\nLike a phoenix, he was reborn from the ashes of his crumbling empire, managing to hold on to a large stake in&nbsp;Norilsk Nickel&nbsp;as the shares collapsed in value. After a divorce of sorts with Prokhorov in 2007, he became the sole owner of Interros, but failed to acquire his former business partner&rsquo;s stake in Norilsk, which went to <a href='http://www.forbes.com/profile/oleg-deripaska/'>Oleg Deripaska</a>, another billionaire oligarch. A dispute with Deripaska was ultimately resolved when a third oligarch, <a href='http://www.forbes.com/profile/roman-abramovich/'>Roman Abramovich</a>, played the role of mediator, allowing Potanin to remain in control of Norilsk.\r\n\r\nLast time we counted, we pegged Potanin&rsquo;s wealth at $15.4 billion, making him Russia&rsquo;s richest man. The bulk of it comes from Norilsk, where he holds a 30.4% stake. Potanin also has interests in Rosbank&mdash;where French bank Societe Generale is a partner&mdash;, digital media company Rowler &amp; Co, pharmaceutical firm NPO Petrovax-Farm, an important real estate portfolio, and the Rosa Khutor ski resort whcih was used in the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi. In 2010, Potanin joined <a href='http://www.forbes.com/ebooks/bill-gates-behind-microsoft-money-malaria/'>Bill Gates</a> and <a href='http://www.forbes.com/ebooks/warren-buffett-59-billion-philanthropist/'>Warren Buffett</a> in signing the giving pledge, indicating he would donate half of his fortune to charity.\r\n\r\nIn February 2014, Potanin divorced his wife and offered her $250,000 a month in alimony, along with properties in Moscow, London, and New York. After a 30 year marriage which includes three children, Natalia believes she deserved more, so she began to pursue his offshore assets. In a recent interview with <a href=\"http://money.cnn.com/2015/06/08/news/russia-richest-man-divorce/\"><em>CNN</em></a>, she said that under Russian law she deserves half of his wealth, which she knows is held overseas, presumably in order to avoid any problems with confiscation or nationalization in Russia. She also indicated she plans to give any shares she gets in Norilsk to the state to &ldquo;avoid corporate conflicts.&rdquo; During the interview, she admitted that as a family the Potanin&rsquo;s have spent up to $10 million on summer vacations.\r\n\r\nNatalia Potanina&rsquo;s legal actions come on the heels of what was a <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/luisakroll/2014/05/19/billionaires-ex-wife-awarded-record-breaking-4-5-billion-but-battle-for-the-money-is-far-from-over/\">record-shattering $4.5 billion divorce between Dmitry Rybolovev and his former wide Elena</a>. While Rybolovlev is appealing a court&rsquo;s decision, Potanin himself has already found himself a new wife. He married Ekaterina in 2014. &ldquo;I feel offended after living together for 30 years,&rdquo; Natalia told <em>CNN</em>, &ldquo;I loved him so much, it was a big personal drama to me.&rdquo;\r\n\r\n[gallery2012]\r\n\r\n<!--donotpaginate-->\r\n\r\n&nbsp;</p>","description":"Russia's Richest man, Vladimir Potanin, built a $15 billion fortune on the back of privatizations and metals giant Norilsk Nickel.

Natalia Potanina, the ex-wife of Russia’s richest man, is looking for half of <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/profile/vladimir-potanin/\" target=\"_self\">Vladimir Potanin</a>’s more than $14 billion fortune in what would be the world’s most expensive divorce. Potanin, an oligarch close to the Kremlin, built his fortune on the back of metals giant <span class=\"quotecard\" article-quote-card=\"\" data-ticker=\"null\" data-exchange=\"null\" data-type=\"organization\" data-naturalid=\"fred/company/3145\" data-quotes-closing=\"0.0\" data-quotes-now=\"0.0\" data-link=\"/companies/norilsk-nickel\" data-name=\"Norilsk Nickel\"></span>, along with a diversified set of investments under holding company Interros, which until 2007 he jointly-owned with Brooklyn Nets-owner <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/profile/mikhail-prokhorov/\" target=\"_self\">Mikhail Prokhorov</a>.</p>\n<p>Potanin followed the traditional Russian oligarch playbook on his way to the top. A former employee of the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations for the USSR, he met Prokhorov in 1991 when he was a manager at the <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/international/\" target=\"_self\">International</a> Bank of Economic Cooperation (IBEC). By 1993, after the Iron Curtain had fallen, Potanin and Prokhorov teamed up to form Uneximbank, luring clients away from IBEC.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_160807014\"> \n <img class=\"dam-image getty size-large wp-image-160807014\" src=\"http://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/160807014/640x0.jpg?fit=scale\" alt=\"\" /> \n <p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Vladimir Putin listens to Potanin during the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi -&nbsp;(Photo credit should read IVAN SEKRETAREV/AFP/Getty Images)</p> \n</div>\n<p>Their big break came two years later when they gained control of metals giant Norilsk Nickel, along with oil firm Sidanco, in the controversial “loans-for-shares” privatizations auctions. Through <a href=\"http://www.interros.ru/en/company/history/\">Interros</a>, a&nbsp;holding company controlled by Potanin and Prokhorov, they expanded into several sectors of the Russian economy, from banking and finance, through commodities and precious metals, and even into media and journalism.</p>\n<div id=\"inread\" article-ad-inbody=\"inread\" class=\"inread\"></div>\n<p>In terms of net worth, Potanin’s rise was only as spectacular as his first fall. He first made his way into the ten digit club in 1998, when we valued him at $1.6 billion. By our 2008 billionaires list, Potanin was the world’s 25th richest man with a fortune of $19.3 billion. As the global financial crisis unfolded, though, he was forced to offload assets, selling stakes in <span class=\"quotecard\" article-quote-card=\"\" data-ticker=\"OPYGY\" data-exchange=\"MICEX\" data-type=\"organization\" data-naturalid=\"fred/company/3431\" data-quotes-closing=\"0.0\" data-quotes-now=\"0.0\" data-link=\"/companies/polyus-gold\" data-name=\"Polyus Gold\"></span> and Prof-Media, the country’s largest media group. His net worth shrunk by a staggering $17.2 billion to $2.1 billion by our 2009 global billionaires issue.</p>\n<p>Like a phoenix, he was reborn from the ashes of his crumbling empire, managing to hold on to a large stake in&nbsp;Norilsk Nickel&nbsp;as the shares collapsed in value. After a divorce of sorts with Prokhorov in 2007, he became the sole owner of Interros, but failed to acquire his former business partner’s stake in Norilsk, which went to <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/profile/oleg-deripaska/\" target=\"_self\">Oleg Deripaska</a>, another billionaire oligarch. A dispute with Deripaska was ultimately resolved when a third oligarch, <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/profile/roman-abramovich/\" target=\"_self\">Roman Abramovich</a>, played the role of mediator, allowing Potanin to remain in control of Norilsk.</p>\n<div class=\"vestpocket\" vest-pocket=\"\"></div>\n<p>Last time we counted, we pegged Potanin’s wealth at $15.4 billion, making him Russia’s richest man. The bulk of it comes from Norilsk, where he holds a 30.4% stake. Potanin also has interests in Rosbank—where French bank Societe Generale is a partner—, digital media company Rowler &amp; Co, pharmaceutical firm NPO Petrovax-Farm, an important real estate portfolio, and the Rosa Khutor ski resort whcih was used in the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi. In 2010, Potanin joined <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/ebooks/bill-gates-behind-microsoft-money-malaria/\" target=\"_self\">Bill Gates</a> and <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/ebooks/warren-buffett-59-billion-philanthropist/\" target=\"_self\">Warren Buffett</a> in signing the giving pledge, indicating he would donate half of his fortune to charity.</p>\n<p>In February 2014, Potanin divorced his wife and offered her $250,000 a month in alimony, along with properties in Moscow, London, and New York. After a 30 year marriage which includes three children, Natalia believes she deserved more, so she began to pursue his offshore assets. In a recent interview with <a href=\"http://money.cnn.com/2015/06/08/news/russia-richest-man-divorce/\"><em>CNN</em></a>, she said that under Russian law she deserves half of his wealth, which she knows is held overseas, presumably in order to avoid any problems with confiscation or nationalization in Russia.
