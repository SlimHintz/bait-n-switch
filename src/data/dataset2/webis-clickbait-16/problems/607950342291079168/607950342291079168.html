The&nbsp;regular <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/ewanspence/2015/06/05/apple-news-digest-ios9-osx-wwdc-iphone-7/\">Apple Loop</a>&nbsp;column here on Forbes has been keeping track of all the&nbsp;potential&nbsp;announcements, but with the event just a few days away let's take a look&nbsp;at the rumors circling around WWDC 2015.\r\n\r\n<strong>Let's Make Sure Nothing Goes Wrong On The iPhone</strong>\r\n\r\nIt's almost certain that Apple will follow the yearly update schedule for its mobile operating system, which means developers can expect to see iOS 9 announced from the stage. This is the OS that will drive Apple's next generation of iPhone handsets, which are typically launched in September with the new OS, and then older devices can receive the over-the-air update.\r\n\r\nBefore then the public beta test will be under way, and WWDC will either kick off this process, or preview&nbsp;iOS 9's developer preview&nbsp;availability 'in the very near future'.\r\n\r\nIndications are that iOS 9 will focus more on stability, and&nbsp;reducing bugs and errors, rather than introducing a specification sheet full of updated apps and features. That does not mean 'no improvements' but 'a few and focused' improvements.\r\n\r\n(<a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/gordonkelly/2015/05/26/apple-ios-9-leak-new-features-iphone-6s-changes/\">Read about&nbsp;the biggest changes in iOS 9 and the next generation of iPhones</a>).\r\n\r\n[gallery2012]\r\n\r\n<strong>More Than Telling The Time</strong>\r\n\r\nOne product&nbsp;where there should&nbsp;be improvements will be in the Apple Watch software. Two areas to watch out for here. The first is user interaction and the core software managing&nbsp;the Apple Watch from iOS devices. Apple will have a lot of feedback now in terms of use cases, dwell time, interactions, and UI navigation.&nbsp;An iterative update to the Apple Watch software is on the cards for WWDC.\r\n\r\nWhat people really want to see is the ability to&nbsp;develop and release third-party native applications for the Apple Watch. I think Apple will remain cautious about this, and while the tools to build and test apps on the wrist will be on show at WWDC,&nbsp;I'm not sure if the firmware update to allow apps to run on consumer watches will be made public. Developer builds, yes, but that naturally limits Apple Watch apps to manual installs against a software certificate.\r\n\r\nApple took its time to allow native apps on the iPhone, and I think the same will be true for the Apple Watch. The capability will be shown, but the keystone won't be made public just yet.\r\n\r\n<strong>A Focus On Desktop Stability And Continuity</strong>\r\n\r\nApple's desktop operating system will also go through its annual update cycle,&nbsp;and just like the update to iOS, the OSX refresh will&nbsp;focus on stability and getting things right, as opposed to pushing new features out the door and into the public eye.\r\n\r\nUnifying features such as Continuity will likely&nbsp;get the lions share of time on stage to show off any new services and data that can be synchronised. &nbsp;The key will be the continued &nbsp;integration of OSX with iCloud and iOS, allowing Tim Cook's team to promote&nbsp;the Apple way of doing things, tying in data on the desktop, on mobile, on the wrist, and in the cloud.\r\n\r\nIf you're playing 'Keynote Bingo' the connected world demonstration is the most likely time for \"This is something only Apple can do\" to make its regular appearance.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_495316189\" align=\"\" width=\"640\"]<img class=\"dam-image getty size-large wp-image-495316189\" src=\"http://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/495316189/640x0.jpg?fit=scale\" alt=\"\"> SAN FRANCISCO, CA - JUNE 02: Attendees gather at the Apple Worldwide Developers Conference at the Moscone West centre,. (Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)[/caption]\r\n\r\n<strong>Let The Music Play (For A Monthly Fee)</strong>\r\n\r\nStaying on services connected to the cloud, there is a widespread expectation that&nbsp;Apple will launch its branded version of the Beats streaming music service.\r\n\r\nPart of me&nbsp;&nbsp;would question why this is going to be announced at a developer's conference rather than a more consumer focused event, but&nbsp;with the world's press looking at Apple over WWDC, there needs to be something for consumers and the media to latch on to. Assuming all the contracts with the record labels are sorted in time (and that's not a given), Apple's purchase of&nbsp;Beats may finally start to deliver the music&nbsp;to iTunes and the Apple ecosystem on Monday.\r\n\r\nWe might even see some superstar DJ names on stage at the event to build up the buzz around the product as well.\r\n\r\n<em>Next page: Apple TV hardware and software, iPad Pros, HomeKit, and the iPhone 6C...</em>\r\n\r\n<!--nextpage-->\r\n\r\n<strong>Apple TV Off The Menu?</strong>\r\n\r\nOne piece of consumer hardware&nbsp;that is not expected to be updated at WWDC is Apple's set-top box.&nbsp;Widely expected to be powered by Apple's A8 processor, support for Siri, and a dedicated storefront, Apple TV has been the perennial bridesmaid, with expectations&nbsp;ahead of every event that 'this is the event where Apple TV grows up'. &nbsp;Today Brian Chen (<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/05/technology/apple-to-unveil-tool-kit-for-watch-app-developers.html\">writing for The New York Times</a>) believes that Apple is&nbsp;postponing the launch due to a lack of completed content deals for the service. This could be brinksmanship with the content providers (see the music subscription service), but it's more likely an issue that is going to take more than a weekend to resolve.\r\n\r\nWith no new hardware, this likely means that an Apple TV SDK for new experiences in the home will not be announced.&nbsp;Without the new hardware to go with it, the SDK would either be a shadow of what it could be, or give away too many secrets in the code&nbsp;to the hardware specifications.\r\n\r\n<strong>Other Hardware Updates... Unlikely</strong>\r\n\r\nThere are a number of hardware lines that Apple could refresh this year, although I feel it is unlikely&nbsp;that we'll see any major&nbsp;hardware announced at WWDC. Apple TV I've already covered, and the recent specifications bump in the MacBook hardware feels like it would preclude any new releases. The Mac Pro and the Mac mini are likely to remain untouched as well.\r\n\r\nI'm fifty/fifty on the appearance of the twelve-inch iPad Pro at WWDC. It's a product that has been teased for some time, but&nbsp;for me it fails to answer&nbsp;any mainstream problems. Apple may have found a problem that the iPad Pro could solve, it may&nbsp;comfortable selling into a small niche, or it might be happy to wait&nbsp;a bit longer to try to find an&nbsp;answer&nbsp;that fits a wider audience.\r\n\r\nHomeKit - Apple's software for home automation - was announced at WWDC 2014 and while developers have had&nbsp;close to a year with the SDK, HomeKit enabled products <del>are not yet&nbsp;on the market</del>&nbsp;are starting to appear - <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/aarontilley/2015/06/02/first-apple-homekit-smart-home-devices/\">Forbes' Aaron Tilley has taken a look at five start-ups launching HomeKit powered products</a> that are part of the Made For iPhone program. Expect&nbsp;an update and perhaps a demonstration of HomeKit in action with some third-party accessories.\r\n\r\n(<em>Updated to include first HomeKit-Certified product information</em>)\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_181331425\" align=\"\" width=\"640\"]<img class=\"dam-image getty size-large wp-image-181331425\" src=\"http://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/181331425/640x0.jpg?fit=scale\" alt=\"\"> A man looks at the new iPhone 5C at the Apple Store at the Americana at Brand shopping complex in Glendale, California.&nbsp;(ROBYN BECK/AFP/Getty Images)[/caption]\r\n\r\n<strong>And What Of The&nbsp;Next iPhone?</strong>\r\n\r\nThe iPhone 6C continues to make waves as more people begin to consider what a four-inch screened replacement for the iPhone 5C could be like. If it's going to make an appearance on Monday it would likely be a very early build, because there is no indication that production has ramped up to meet demand. For this reason, and Apple's diligence in following the yearly release schedule, I don't expect the iPhone 6C to make an appearance&nbsp;at WWDC - after all, the&nbsp;two-year contracts for iPhone 5C users won't be up for renewal until&nbsp;September.\r\n\r\n<em>Forbes will be keeping you up to date with news from WWDC and the impact on the market.&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/miguelhelft/\">Miguel Heft will be live blogging the keynote</a>&nbsp;from Monday at 10am Pacific, and the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/technology\">Forbes Tech team</a>&nbsp;will bring you the stories as they happen.</em></p>","description":"Once more Apple is preparing for the annual Worldwide Developers Conference, and while the attendees will be focusing on the many sessions and demonstrations, there's an anticipation around the keynote speech from Tim Cook and his team that will open up the events on Monday.

This is the OS that will drive Apple’s next generation of iPhone handsets, which are typically launched in September with the new OS, and then older devices can receive the over-the-air update.</p>\n<p>Before then the public beta test will be under way, and WWDC will either kick off this process, or preview&nbsp;iOS 9′s developer preview&nbsp;availability ‘in the very near future’.</p>\n<p>Indications are that iOS 9 will focus more on stability, and&nbsp;reducing bugs and errors, rather than introducing a specification sheet full of updated apps and features. That does not mean ‘no improvements’ but ‘a few and focused’ improvements.</p>\n<p>(<a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/gordonkelly/2015/05/26/apple-ios-9-leak-new-features-iphone-6s-changes/\" target=\"_self\">Read about&nbsp;the biggest changes in iOS 9 and the next generation of iPhones</a>).</p>\n<div class=\"article-gallery-embedded\" data-url=\"http://www.forbes.com/pictures/ekhf45emkgl/one-of-ioss-niftiest-fea/\"> \n <div class=\"embedded-content clearfix\"> \n  <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/pictures/ekhf45emkgl/one-of-ioss-niftiest-fea/\" class=\"clearfix\" target=\"_self\"> \n   <div class=\"article-image-box\"> \n    <!--start:main_image--> \n    <img src=\"http://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/c8f4f82ecf4a6119862504aaa3953b3d/400x400.jpg?fit=scale&amp;background=000000\" alt=\"\" /> \n    <!--end:main_image--> \n   </div> \n   <div class=\"article-text-box\"> \n    <header> \n     <i class=\"icon icon-gallery\"></i>Gallery \n    </header> \n    <h4>iPhone 6 Tips And Tricks</h4> \n    <div class=\"article-launch-gallery\"> \n     <span class=\"article-launch-text\">Launch Gallery</span> \n     <div class=\"article-slide-count\">\n       8 images \n     </div> \n    </div> \n    <button class=\"article-launch-button\"><i class=\"icon icon-chevron-right\"></i></button> \n   </div></a> \n </div> \n</div>\n<div id=\"inread\" article-ad-inbody=\"inread\" class=\"inread\"></div>\n<p><strong>More Than Telling The Time</strong></p>\n<p>One product&nbsp;where there should&nbsp;be improvements will be in the Apple Watch software. Two areas to watch out for here. The first is user interaction and the core software managing&nbsp;the Apple Watch from iOS devices. Apple will have a lot of feedback now in terms of use cases, dwell time, interactions, and UI navigation.&nbsp;An iterative update to the Apple Watch software is on the cards for WWDC.</p>\n<p>What people really want to see is the ability to&nbsp;develop and release third-party native applications for the Apple Watch. I think Apple will remain cautious about this, and while the tools to build and test apps on the wrist will be on show at WWDC,&nbsp;I’m not sure if the firmware update to allow apps to run on consumer watches will be made public. Developer builds, yes, but that naturally limits Apple Watch apps to manual installs against a software certificate.</p>\n<div class=\"vestpocket\" vest-pocket=\"\"></div>\n<p>Apple took its time to allow native apps on the iPhone, and I think the same will be true for the Apple Watch. The capability will be shown, but the keystone won’t be made public just yet.</p>\n<p><strong>A Focus On Desktop Stability And Continuity</strong></p>\n<p>Apple’s desktop operating system will also go through its annual update cycle,&nbsp;and just like the update to iOS, the OSX refresh will&nbsp;focus on stability and getting things right, as opposed to pushing new features out the door and into the public eye.</p>\n<p>Unifying features such as Continuity will likely&nbsp;get the lions share of time on stage to show off any new services and data that can be synchronised. &nbsp;The key will be the continued &nbsp;integration of OSX with iCloud and iOS, allowing Tim Cook’s team to promote&nbsp;the Apple way of doing things, tying in data on the desktop, on mobile, on the wrist, and in the cloud.</p>\n<p>If you’re playing ‘Keynote Bingo’ the connected world demonstration is the most likely time for “This is something only Apple can do” to make its regular appearance.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_495316189\"> \n <img class=\"dam-image getty size-large wp-image-495316189\" src=\"http://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/495316189/640x0.jpg?fit=scale\" alt=\"\" /> \n <p class=\"wp-caption-text\">SAN FRANCISCO, CA – JUNE 02: Attendees gather at the Apple Worldwide Developers Conference at the Moscone West centre,. (Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)</p> \n</div>\n<p><strong>Let The Music Play (For A Monthly Fee)</strong></p>\n<p>Staying on services connected to the cloud, there is a widespread expectation that&nbsp;Apple will launch its branded version of the Beats streaming music service.</p>\n<p>Part of me&nbsp;&nbsp;would question why this is going to be announced at a developer’s conference rather than a more consumer focused event, but&nbsp;with the world’s press looking at Apple over WWDC, there needs to be something for consumers and the media to latch on to. Assuming all the contracts with the record labels are sorted in time (and that’s not a given), Apple’s purchase of&nbsp;Beats may finally start to deliver the music&nbsp;to iTunes and the Apple ecosystem on Monday.</p>\n<p>We might even see some superstar DJ names on stage at the event to build up the buzz around the product as well.</p>\n<p><em>Next page: Apple TV hardware and software, iPad Pros, HomeKit, and the iPhone 6C…</em></p>","<p><strong>Apple TV Off The Menu?</strong></p>\n<p>One piece of consumer hardware&nbsp;that is not expected to be updated at WWDC is Apple’s set-top box.&nbsp;Widely expected to be powered by Apple’s A8 processor, support for Siri, and a dedicated storefront, Apple TV has been the perennial bridesmaid, with expectations&nbsp;ahead of every event that ‘this is the event where Apple TV grows up’. &nbsp;Today Brian Chen (<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/05/technology/apple-to-unveil-tool-kit-for-watch-app-developers.html\">writing for The New York Times</a>) believes that Apple is&nbsp;postponing the launch due to a lack of completed content deals for the service. This could be brinksmanship with the content providers (see the music subscription service), but it’s more likely an issue that is going to take more than a weekend to resolve.</p>\n<p>With no new hardware, this likely means that an Apple TV SDK for new experiences in the home will not be announced.&nbsp;Without the new hardware to go with it, the SDK would either be a shadow of what it could be, or give away too many secrets in the code&nbsp;to the hardware specifications.</p>\n<p><strong>Other Hardware Updates… Unlikely</strong></p>\n<p>There are a number of hardware lines that Apple could refresh this year, although I feel it is unlikely&nbsp;that we’ll see any major&nbsp;hardware announced at WWDC. Apple TV I’ve already covered, and the recent specifications bump in the MacBook hardware feels like it would preclude any new releases. The Mac Pro and the Mac mini are likely to remain untouched as well.</p>\n<div id=\"inread\" article-ad-inbody=\"inread\" class=\"inread\"></div>\n<p>I’m fifty/fifty on the appearance of the twelve-inch iPad Pro at WWDC. It’s a product that has been teased for some time, but&nbsp;for me it fails to answer&nbsp;any mainstream problems. Apple may have found a problem that the iPad Pro could solve, it may&nbsp;comfortable selling into a small niche, or it might be happy to wait&nbsp;a bit longer to try to find an&nbsp;answer&nbsp;that fits a wider audience.</p>\n<p>HomeKit – Apple’s software for home automation – was announced at WWDC 2014 and while developers have had&nbsp;close to a year with the SDK, HomeKit enabled products <del>are not yet&nbsp;on the market</del>&nbsp;are starting to appear – <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/aarontilley/2015/06/02/first-apple-homekit-smart-home-devices/\" target=\"_self\">Forbes’ Aaron Tilley has taken a look at five start-ups launching HomeKit powered products</a> that are part of the Made For iPhone program. Expect&nbsp;an update and perhaps a demonstration of HomeKit in action with some third-party accessories.</p>\n<div class=\"vestpocket\" vest-pocket=\"\"></div>\n<p>(<em>Updated to include first HomeKit-Certified product information</em>)</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_181331425\"> \n <img class=\"dam-image getty size-large wp-image-181331425\" src=\"http://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/181331425/640x0.jpg?fit=scale\" alt=\"\" /> \n <p class=\"wp-caption-text\">A man looks at the new iPhone 5C at the Apple Store at the Americana at Brand shopping complex in Glendale, California.&nbsp;(ROBYN BECK/AFP/Getty Images)</p> \n</div>\n<p><strong>And What Of The&nbsp;Next iPhone?</strong></p>\n<p>The iPhone 6C continues to make waves as more people begin to consider what a four-inch screened replacement for the iPhone 5C could be like. If it’s going to make an appearance on Monday it would likely be a very early build, because there is no indication that production has ramped up to meet demand. For this reason, and Apple’s diligence in following the yearly release schedule, I don’t expect the iPhone 6C to make an appearance&nbsp;at WWDC – after all, the&nbsp;two-year contracts for iPhone 5C users won’t be up for renewal until&nbsp;September.</p>\n<p><em>Forbes will be keeping you up to date with news from WWDC and the impact on the market.&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/miguelhelft/\" target=\"_self\">Miguel Heft will be live blogging the keynote</a>&nbsp;from Monday at 10am Pacific, and the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/technology\" target=\"_self\">Forbes Tech team</a>&nbsp;will bring you the stories as they happen.</em></p>"],"galleryId":"54f4e700da47a54de824411e","disableDigest":false,"writtenByForbesStaff":false,"channelSectionMappings":[{"id":"channel_3","channelName":"Tech","url":"/technology"},{"id":"channel_3section_22","channelName":"Tech","sectionName":"Mobile","url":"/mobile"},{"id":"channel_3section_76","channelName":"Tech","sectionName":"Social Media","url":"/social-media"},{"id":"channel_3section_78","channelName":"Tech","sectionName":"Gear","url":"/gear"}],"digestDisabled":false,"images":{"featured":{"url":"http://blogs-images.forbes.com/ewanspence/files/2014/10/Tim-Cook-e1414678372631.jpeg","width":1011,"height":568,"title":"Tim Cook","caption":"Apple CEO Tim Cook.
