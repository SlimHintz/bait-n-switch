THE STRONGEST HURRICANE EVER -- A CATEGORY-FIVE MONSTER MAKING LANDFALL WITH WINDS CLOSE TO 200 MILES AN HOUR. URGENT WARNINGS AND EVACUATIONS IN MEXICO. ENTIRE CITIES COULD BE WIPED OFF THE MAP. AL ROKER IS HERE. HILLARY CLINTON&#65533;S FIRST INTERVIEW SINCE THAT SHOWDOWN OVER BENGHAZI. PLUS, A STUNNING DOWNTURN FOR JEB BUSH. TRAILING IN THE POLLS, NOW MAKING MAJOR CUTS. IS HIS CAMPAIGN IN CRISIS? IS IT A HEALTH HAZARD? OUR INVESTIGATION INTO ARTIFICIAL TURF MADE UP FROM GROUND-UP TIRES. KIDS PLAY ON IT EVERY DAY. AFTER THE EPA REFUSED TO ANSWER OUR QUESTIONS, NOW CONGRESS IS DEMANDING ANSWERS. AND THE PACKAGE PILE-UP HAPPENING ALL ACROSS THE COUNTRY THANKS TO THE EXPLOSION OF ONLINE SHOPPING. A DELIVERY DILEMMA. WHERE DO YOU PUT IT ALL? &quot;NIGHTLY NEWS&quot; BEGINS RIGHT NOW. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Announcer: FROM NBC NEWS WORLD HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS IS &quot;NBC NIGHTLY NEWS&quot; WITH LESTER HOLT. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Holt: GOOD EVENING. RIGHT NOW, MILLIONS ARE BRACING FOR A HURRICANE THE LIKES OF WHICH WE&#65533;VE NEVER SEEN. IT IS CALLED PATRICIA. IT IS THE STRONGEST HURRICANE EVER RECORDED. RIGHT NOW IT IS MAKING WHAT IS FEARED TO BE A CATASTROPHIC LANDFALL ALONG MEXICO&#65533;S PACIFIC COAST. THE CATEGORY-FIVE STORM EXPLODED INTO A MONSTER OVERNIGHT, LEAVING RESIDENTS AND TOURISTS IN RESORT CITIES, INCLUDING MANZANILLO AND PUERTO VALLARTA, SCRAMBLING TO GET AWAY IN TIME. FROM SPACE, THE STORM IS OMINOUS ENOUGH, BUT INSIDE, IT&#65533;S PACKING WIND GUSTS UP TO 235 MILES PER HOUR. ALSO TORRENTIAL RAINS EXPECTED TO CARRY INTO TEXAS BEFORE THIS IS ALL OVER. NBC&#65533;s JOE FRYER HAS MADE HIS WAY TO THE MEXICAN COAST AND HAS LATE DETAILS. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Fryer: LIKE A STEAMROLLER, HURRICANE PATRICIA IS BARRELING TOWARD MEXICO&#65533;S PACIFIC COAST, CATCHING MUCH OF THIS PARADISE OFF-GUARD. PATRICIA EXPLODED OVERNIGHT FROM A TROPICAL STORM TO A MAJOR HURRICANE DUE IN PART TO THE EL NI&#65533;O EFFECT -- THE UNUSUALLY WARM WATERS ACTING AS JET FUEL FOR THE STORM. IN THE POPULAR RESORT DESTINATION PUERTO VALLARTA, BUSINESS OWNERS BOARDED UP WINDOWS, AND PEOPLE RACED TO BOARD BUSES OUT OF TOWN. EMERGENCY WORKERS WENT STREET TO STREET, URGING RESIDENTS TO EVACUATE. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Man: EVERYBODY&#65533;S TALKING ABOUT HOW TO GET OUT OF PUERTO VALLARTA. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Fryer: THIS WOMAN HAS BEEN TRYING TO LEAVE SINCE YESTERDAY. SHE CRIES AFTER LEARNING THAT ALL THE PLANES HAVE BEEN GROUNDED. A GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL WENT ON TELEVISION WARNING ABOUT THE STORM&#65533;S POWER -- STRONG ENOUGH, HE SAYS, TO LIFT CARS, DESTROY HOMES, AND SWEEP PEOPLE AWAY. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Norcross: THIS HURRICANE IS SO STRONG, IT IS COMPARABLE TO AN EF-4 TORNADO BUT HUGE COMPARED TO THE SIZE OF A NORMAL TORNADO. SO WHERE THIS COMES ASHORE, WE EXPECT JUST TOTAL DEVASTATION. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Fryer: HURRICANE PATRICIA IS NOW THE STRONGEST STORM EVER RECORDED IN THE WESTERN HEMISPHERE WITH WINDS THAT COULD REACH AN EXTRAORDINARY 200 MILES AN HOUR. IT&#65533;S MORE THAN DOUBLE THE STRENGTH OF SUPERSTORM SANDY, WHICH LANDED IN NEW YORK CITY WITH WINDS AT 80 MILES AN HOUR. HURRICANE KATRINA WAS GOING 125 MILES AN HOUR AT LANDFALL. EVEN HURRICANE ANDREW, A CATEGORY FIVE, WASN&#65533;T THIS BIG. 165 MILES AN HOUR WHEN IT MADE LANDFALL IN FLORIDA, MORE THAN TWO DOZEN PEOPLE LOST THEIR LIVES. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Cardero: I WOULD BE LYING IF I SAID I WASN&#65533;T ANXIOUS AND SCARED. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Fryer: ROSIE CARDERO LIVED THROUGH HURRICANE ANDREW AND SAYS SHE&#65533;S AFRAID FOR THE LOCALS. WE REACHED HER BY SKYPE AS SHE WAS PREPARING TO EVACUATE HER HOTEL. AT ANOTHER HOTEL, WE SPOKE TO BRANDY AND HER HUSBAND KEN. THEY TOLD US THEY&#65533;RE WORRIED ABOUT GETTING BACK TO OREGON. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Brandy: HONESTLY, IT&#65533;S REALLY TERRIFYING. I HAVE CHILDREN AT HOME, AND I MISS THEM. I MISS MY FAMILY. YOU KNOW, AND WE&#65533;VE NEVER BEEN THROUGH ANYTHING LIKE THIS BEFORE. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Fryer: HERE IN IXTAPA, A FEW HOURS SOUTH OF THE HURRICANE&#65533;S EYE, WE&#65533;RE ALREADY SEEING LOTS OF RAIN, STRONG WINDS, AND GROWING WAVES. MILLIONS LIVE IN THE HURRICANE ZONE, A COASTAL AREA THAT&#65533;S DOTTED NOT JUST BY TOP-NOTCH RESORTS, BUT ALSO FISHING VILLAGES. AND TONIGHT, THERE IS CONCERN MANY HOMES MAY NOT BE STURDY ENOUGH TO WITHSTAND THIS HISTORY-MAKING STORM. LESTER? &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Holt: JOE FRYER IN MEXICO THIS EVENING. AND THE REMNANTS OF PATRICIA WILL COMBINE WITH ANOTHER STORM SYSTEM WE&#65533;RE MONITORING ROLLING THROUGH THE SOUTH CENTRAL U.S., PART OF A MULTI-DAY FLASH FLOOD THREAT FROM TORRENTIAL RAIN IN PARTS OF TEXAS, OKLAHOMA, ARKANSAS, AND LOUISIANA. IN FACT, SOME PARTS OF TEXAS COULD SEE A FOOT OF RAIN. THE STORM HAS ALREADY FORCED THE CANCELATION OF HUNDREDS OF FLIGHTS IN DALLAS. AL ROKER IS HERE. HE&#65533;S MONITORING BOTH SYSTEMS. AL, LET&#65533;S START WITH THAT MONSTER HURRICANE. HOW DO YOU SEE THIS PLAYING OUT? &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Roker: WELL, LESTER, I THINK RIGHT NOW, WE MAY ACTUALLY HAVE SEEN LANDFALL ON THIS. RIGHT NOW, YOU CAN WATCH THE EYE COME ON SHORE RIGHT THERE BETWEEN PUERTO VALLARTA AND MANZANILLO. IT PROBABLY CAME ON SHORE WITH 190 MILE PER HOUR WINDS. IT&#65533;S MOVING NORTH-NORTHEAST AT 14 MILES PER HOUR. IT WILL RAPIDLY LOSE STRENGTH AS WE MOVE THROUGH SATURDAY ON INTO SUNDAY. BUT ITS REMNANTS AND MOISTURE WILL PUSH ALL THE WAY ON UP INTO TEXAS. AND THAT IS WHAT WE&#65533;RE WORRIED ABOUT. WE ALREADY HAVE FLASH FLOOD WATCHES AND WARNINGS STRETCHING FROM CENTRAL TEXAS INTO LOUISIANA. THESE LAST INTO EARLY NEXT WEEK COMBINED WITH MOISTURE FROM THE GULF AND PATRICIA. CORSICANA, TEXAS, ALREADY HAS PICKED UP NINE INCHES OF RAIN. MORE RAIN COMES IN TOMORROW. UPWARDS OF 5 TO 10 INCHES FROM HOUSTON, GALVESTON TO CORPUS CHRISTI. AND SUNDAY, LESTER, SOME AREAS -- 10 INCHES. BY MONDAY MORNING, 15 INCHES OF RAIN COULD HAVE FALLEN IN PARTS OF THE SOUTHERN GULF. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Holt: ALL RIGHT. AL ROKER, THANKS VERY MUCH. AFTER MONTHS OF BUMPS IN THE ROAD AND STRUGGLES FOR HER CAMPAIGN, HILLARY CLINTON WAS BACK ON THE TRAIL TODAY, RIDING HIGH AFTER WHAT HAS BEEN SEEN AS A CONFIDENT PERFORMANCE BEFORE THE BENGHAZI COMMITTEE. AND NEW POLL NUMBERS SHOWING SHE IS PICKING UP LOST GROUND. WE&#65533;RE HEARING THIS EVENING FROM THE FORMER SECRETARY OF STATE IN HER FIRST INTERVIEW SINCE THAT BENGHAZI SHOWDOWN. NBC&#65533;s ANDREA MITCHELL WITH CLINTON&#65533;S FIRST RESPONSE. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Clinton: HELLO, EVERYBODY. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Mitchell: THE DAY AFTER HER 11-HOUR BENGHAZI MARATHON, HILLARY CLINTON IS TRYING TO KEEP THE MOMENTUM GOING, GREETING SUPPORTERS AT A RALLY IN VIRGINIA. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Mitchell: WHAT WAS YOUR REACTION AFTER THE HEARING? &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Clinton: I&#65533;M HAPPY TO BE HERE ON THIS VERY SUNNY DAY. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Mitchell: IN AN EXCLUSIVE INTERVIEW TO AIR TONIGHT ON MSNBC, RACHEL MADDOW ASKED CLINTON HOW HER MOM WOULD HAVE REACTED TO THE HEARING. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Clinton: I THINK SHE WOULD HAVE BEEN APPALLED AT THE WHOLE SPECTACLE. SHE WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN SURPRISED BY MY SITTING THERE AND ABSORBING WHAT I DID YESTERDAY BECAUSE THAT IS WHAT SHE WOULD HAVE EXPECTED. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Mitchell: THE LAST 10 DAYS IN OCTOBER HAVE BEEN THE BEST OF CLINTON&#65533;S CAMPAIGN. A STRONG DEBATE PERFORMANCE, JOE BIDEN&#65533;S DECISION NOT TO RUN, SURVIVING THAT BENGHAZI HEARING, AND TODAY, AN ENDORSEMENT FROM THE LABOR UNION REPRESENTING GOVERNMENT WORKERS. AND CLINTON NOW LEADS BERNIE SANDERS AMONG IOWA DEMOCRATS BY 11 POINTS IN A NEW POLL AFTER TRAILING HIM BY ONE POINT A MONTH AGO. THEY BOTH APPEARED AT A WOMEN&#65533;S DEMOCRATIC FORUM TODAY WHERE SHE JABBED AT HIM FOR SAYING LAST WEEK ALL OF THE SHOUTING IN THE WORLD WON&#65533;T KEEP GUNS AWAY FROM PEOPLE WHO SHOULDN&#65533;T HAVE THEM. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Clinton: I&#65533;VE BEEN TOLD TO STOP, AND I QUOTE, &quot;SHOUTING ABOUT GUN VIOLENCE.&quot; WELL, FIRST OF ALL, I&#65533;M NOT SHOUTING. [ LAUGHTER ] IT IS JUST WHEN WOMEN TALK, SOME PEOPLE THINK WE&#65533;RE SHOUTING. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Mitchell: TOMORROW CLINTON GOES TO THE SAME IOWA EVENT WHERE EIGHT YEARS AGO, BARACK OBAMA ROLLED OVER HER CAMPAIGN AND HARDLY EVER LOOKED BACK. BILL CLINTON WILL JOIN HIS WIFE IN IOWA TOMORROW, ONE OF THE FIRST CAMPAIGN APPEARANCES WITH HER. SO WHILE SHE AWAITS THE RESULTS OF THE FBI INVESTIGATION INTO HER PRIVATE SERVER, HER CAMPAIGN AIDES THINK THAT THEY ARE FINALLY ON A ROLL. AND YOU CAN SEE THE WHOLE RACHEL MADDOW INTERVIEW TONIGHT ON MSNBC, LESTER. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Holt: ALL RIGHT, ANDREA, THAT AIRS AT 9:00 EASTERN ON MSNBC. THERE ARE ALSO BIG DEVELOPMENTS ON THE REPUBLICAN SIDE TONIGHT. SURPRISE WORD FROM THE JEB BUSH CAMPAIGN. AFTER FALLING BEHIND BADLY IN THE POLLS, THEY&#65533;RE NOW MAKING MAJOR CUTS AMONG STAFFERS AND THEIR SALARIES. NBC&#65533;s HALLIE JACKSON ON A CAMPAIGN IN POTENTIAL CRISIS MODE. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Jackson: TURNS OUT THE ESTABLISHMENT HEAVYWEIGHT NEEDS TRIMMING DOWN. JEB BUSH&#65533;S CAMPAIGN CUTTING 40% OF ITS PAYROLL TO HELP SAVE MORE THAN A MILLION DOLLARS A MONTH, SHIFTING STAFF TO THE KEY BATTLEGROUND STATE OF NEW HAMPSHIRE. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Bush: THIS MEANS LEAN AND MEAN, AND IT MEANS THAT I HAVE THE ABILITY TO ADAPT. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Jackson: THE COURSE CORRECTION, A SIGNAL BUSH UNDERSTANDS THIS IS A DIFFERENT RACE THAN SIX MONTHS AGO BEFORE OUTSIDERS STARTED RISING. BUT EVEN AS BUSH CUTS BACK, ONE OF HIS BIGGEST RIVALS IS RAMPING UP -- FELLOW FLORIDIAN MARCO RUBIO, ADDING 20% MORE STAFF OVER THE LAST MONTH. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Fage: IF YOU&#65533;RE MARCO RUBIO OR JEB BUSH, YOU NEED THOSE OUTSIDER CANDIDATES TO FALTER. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Jackson: BUSH, STILL MIRED IN THE MIDDLE NATIONALLY, UNLIKE BEN CARSON, NOW RUNNING NEW ADS IN IOWA, WHERE HE&#65533;S SURGING TO THE LEAD DESPITE CAMPAIGNING THERE JUST ONE DAY IN THE LAST TWO MONTHS. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Carson: I&#65533;M GRATIFIED BY THE FACT THAT SO MANY PEOPLE ARE REALLY PAYING ATTENTION TO WHAT I&#65533;M SAYING BECAUSE NONE OF THE THINGS THAT I&#65533;M SAYING ARE WILD, CRAZY THINGS. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Jackson: PROPELLED BY A STRONG SHOWING AMONG WOMEN AND EVANGELICALS, CARSON&#65533;S RISE COMES AT DONALD TRUMP&#65533;S EXPENSE. TRUMP, WHO LOVES BRAGGING ABOUT HIS NUMBERS... &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Trumo: TODAY IS THE 100th DAY WE&#65533;VE BEEN NUMBER ONE. I LOVE POLLS. WE&#65533;RE IN FIRST PLACE. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Jackson: ...MAY NEED A NEW LINE AS THE SUMMER OF TRUMP GIVES WAY TO A FALL IN IOWA FOR NOW. TRUMP&#65533;S STILL LEADING NATIONALLY, AND EVEN AS HE HOLDS BIG RALLIES HERE IN FLORIDA THIS WEEKEND, JEB BUSH WILL HOLD PRIVATE EVENTS IN TEXAS WITH SUPPORTERS AND TWO FORMER PRESIDENTS, HIS FATHER AND BROTHER. HALLIE JACKSON, NBC NEWS, MIAMI. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Holt: WE NOW KNOW THE IDENTITY OF THE AMERICAN SOLDIER KILLED IN IRAQ THIS WEEK, THE FIRST TO FALL IN BATTLE THERE IN FOUR YEARS AND THE FIRST EVER TO BE KILLED IN DIRECT COMBAT WITH ISIS. OUR CHIEF FOREIGN CORRESPONDENT RICHARD ENGEL HAS MADE HIS WAY TO NORTHERN IRAQ AND HAS MORE ON THIS LOSS OF AN AMERICAN LIFE AND CONCERNS THERE MAY BE MORE CASUALTIES TO COME. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Engel: THE PENTAGON TODAY IDENTIFIED MASTER SERGEANT JOSHUA WHEELER OF OKLAHOMA AS THE AMERICAN COMMANDO KILLED IN THE RAID THAT RESCUED 70 HOSTAGES IN IRAQ THIS WEEK. WHEELER, 39, SERVED 14 TOURS OF DUTY IN IRAQ AND AFGHANISTAN. HE ENLISTED 20 YEARS AGO, STRAIGHT OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL. AT THAT SCHOOL TODAY, HE WAS REMEMBERED WITH A MOMENT OF SILENCE. SECRETARY OF DEFENSE CARTER SAID WHEELER ACTED HEROICALLY. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Carter: WHEN A FIREFIGHT ENSUED, THIS AMERICAN DID WHAT I&#65533;M VERY PROUD THAT AMERICANS DO IN THAT SITUATION -- HE RAN TO THE SOUND OF THE GUNS AND HE STOOD UP. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Engel: AND HE ACKNOWLEDGED TO NBC&#65533;s JIM MIKLASZEWSKI THAT U.S. TROOPS ARE IN COMBAT IN IRAQ. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Miklaszewski: YOU SEEM VERY IMPRESSED BY WHAT HAD HAPPENED. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Carter: I AM, AND I TELL YOU, THAT&#65533;S ON THE BASIS OF THE REPORTS I&#65533;VE GOTTEN, SO I WANT TO BE CAREFUL ABOUT THAT BECAUSE THIS IS COMBAT, THINGS ARE COMPLICATED. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Engel: &quot;THIS IS COMBAT,&quot; HE SAID, AND ADDED THERE WOULD BE MORE RAIDS LIKE THIS. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Carter: I EXPECT THAT WE&#65533;LL DO MORE OF THIS KIND OF THING. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Engel: IT&#65533;S A FAR CRY FROM WHAT PRESIDENT OBAMA HAS SAID REPEATEDLY. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; President Obama: WE WILL NOT BE SENDING U.S. TROOPS BACK INTO COMBAT IN IRAQ. AMERICAN FORCES WILL NOT BE RETURNING TO COMBAT IN IRAQ. AMERICAN COMBAT TROOPS WILL NOT BE RETURNING TO FIGHT IN IRAQ. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Engel: THIS IS A ALLEGEDLY WHERE U.S. TROOPS WERE IN COMBAT IN IRAQ THIS WEEK. ISIS CLAIMS THIS FOOTAGE IT POSTS ONLINE SHOWS WHAT IS LEFT OF ITS PRISON, THE BATTLEFIELD WHERE JOSHUA WHEELER LOST HIS LIFE. THE RAID ON THE PRISON WAS LAUNCHED FROM HERE IN NORTHERN IRAQ. U.S. SPECIAL OPERATIONS FORCES HAVE A LARGE PRESENCE HERE AND WHAT SOUNDS LIKE A NEW MISSION, A GREEN LIGHT FROM THE PENTAGON TO GO INTO BATTLE AGAINST ISIS IN IRAQ. LESTER? &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Holt: RICHARD ENGEL. NOW A MAJOR UPDATE ON A STORY WE&#65533;VE BEEN FOLLOWING FOR MORE THAN A YEAR. CITING A SERIES OF NBC NEWS INVESTIGATIVE REPORTS ON THE POTENTIAL HEALTH RISK OF CRUMB RUBBER IN ARTIFICIAL TURF. CONGRESS IS NOW DEMANDING ANSWERS. IT IS PUTTING THE EPA ON THE HOT SEAT AFTER THE AGENCY REFUSED TO RESPOND TO VITAL QUESTIONS WE POSED ABOUT THE SAFETY OF THE FIELDS OUR CHILDREN PLAY ON ALL ACROSS THE COUNTRY. NBC&#65533;s STEPHANIE GOSK HAS BEEN REPORTING ON THIS STORY, AND SHE HAS THE LATEST. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Gosk: COACH AMY GRIFFIN STARTED ASKING QUESTIONS ABOUT CRUMB RUBBER TURF TWO YEARS AGO. SHE WORRIED THE SURFACE MADE FROM RECYCLED CAR AND TRUCK TIRES MAY BE CAUSING CANCER IN SOCCER PLAYERS, SPECIFICALLY GOALIES. IN THE LAST YEAR, HER RUNNING LIST OF SICK GOALKEEPERS NEARLY DOUBLED FROM 34 TO 63 AFTER A SERIES OF NBC NEWS REPORTS. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Griffin: I GOT A BAZILLION E-MAILS, LOTS OF PHONE CALLS, MOSTLY FROM PEOPLE THAT HAD SAID, &quot;I&#65533;VE ALWAYS WONDERED ABOUT THIS.&quot; &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Gosk: WE TRIED REPEATEDLY FOR WELL OVER A YEAR TO GET THE EPA TO ANSWER COACH GRIFFIN&#65533;S QUESTIONS AND OURS. BUT THE AGENCY DID NOT. IS CRUMB RUBBER TURF SAFE FOR OUR CHILDREN TO PLAY ON? &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; McCarthy: I&#65533;M SORRY. I HAVE NOTHING TO SAY RIGHT NOW. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Gosk: NOW CONGRESS WANTS ANSWERS. TODAY, THE HOUSE COMMERCE COMMITTEE WROTE TO THE EPA, CITING NBC NEWS REPORTING, ASKING 10 QUESTIONS, AMONG THEM... AND... SIGNED BY BIPARTISAN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. THE INDUSTRY INSISTS CRUMB RUBBER IS SAFE, CITING DOZENS OF STUDIES. AND THERE IS NO SCIENTIFIC PROOF OF A LINK TO CANCER. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Reddy: WHY CAN&#65533;T THE EPA ACT? THERE IS MORE THAN ENOUGH INFORMATION FOR THEM TO ACT. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Gosk: BUT THE EPA ITSELF SAYS MORE RESEARCH NEEDS TO BE DONE ON CRUMB RUBBER. IF THAT&#65533;S REALLY THE CASE, WHY ARE CHILDREN STILL PLAYING ON IT? THE COMMITTEE IS ASKING FOR ANSWERS BY FRIDAY, NOVEMBER 6th. DEPENDING ON THE AGENCY&#65533;S RESPONSE, LESTER, THIS COULD LEAD TO A FUTURE CONGRESSIONAL HEARING ON CRUMB RUBBER TURF. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Holt: ALL RIGHT, WE KNOW YOU&#65533;LL STAY ON THIS STORY. STEPHANIE, THANK YOU. STILL AHEAD TONIGHT, NO ROOM IN THE MAIL ROOM. WITH ONLINE SALES SKYROCKETING, WHY A GROWING PROBLEM COULD KEEP YOU FROM GETTING ALL THOSE BOXES YOU&#65533;RE EXPECTING TO ARRIVE WITH THE HOLIDAYS JUST AROUND THE CORNER. WE&#65533;RE BACK WITH THE NEW PROBLEM FACING THE MILLIONS OF US WHO SHOP ONLINE. EXPERTS SAY ONLINE RETAIL SALES ARE EXPECTED TO SOAR TO $334 BILLION THIS YEAR, UP FROM $263 BILLION JUST TWO YEARS AGO. BUT ALL OF THE ORDERS HAVE TO BE SHIPPED, WHICH IS CAUSING AN AVALANCHE OF BOXES IN THE MAIL LIKE NEVER BEFORE. NOW, AS NBC&#65533;s GABE GUITERREZ EXPLAINS, SOME WHO HAVE TO HANDLE THEM ON THE WAY TO OUR DOORS ARE TOTALLY FED UP. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Gutierrez: THE DELIVERY DILEMMA HAS LANDLORDS, COLLEGES, AND GEOVANY THOMAS BOXED IN. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Thomas: THE NEW TECHNOLOGY IS TAKING OVER WITH THE INTERNET SHOPPING AND ALL OF THAT STUFF. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Gutierrez: A UPS DRIVER FOR 10 YEARS, HE&#65533;S NEVER SEEN A PACKAGE PROBLEM LIKE THIS. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Thomas: I&#65533;M SEEING MORE PACKAGES NOW THAN BEFORE. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Gutierrez: UPS IS DELIVERING MORE PACKAGES THAN EVER. LAST YEAR, MORE THAN 14 MILLION DAILY. THE SHIPPING GIANT EXPECTS THAT NUMBER TO GROW 50% OVER THE NEXT FIVE YEARS. THE REASONS? MORE PEOPLE ARE LIVING IN APARTMENTS AND MANY MORE ARE SHOPPING ONLINE. JULIE FIELDS MANAGES AN APARTMENT COMPLEX IN ATLANTA. AT TIMES, IT CAN BE OVERWHELMING. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Fields: YES, IT CAN. SEVERAL TIMES THROUGHOUT THE DAY, SOMETIMES WE&#65533;LL HAVE A LOBBY FULL OF OUR RESIDENTS THAT ARE ALL WAITING ON PACKAGES. AND WE&#65533;RE JUST BACK AND FORTH GETTING THE BOXES FOR THEM. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Gutierrez: THE PACKAGE PILEUP HAS GOTTEN SO BAD, ONE OF THE COUNTRY&#65533;S LARGEST APARTMENT OPERATORS HAS STOPPED ACCEPTING THEM AT THEIR OFFICES. IN A LETTER TO RESIDENTS, CAMDEN PROPERTY TRUST SAYS... CHRISTINE BEALER SAYS SHE AND MANY OF HER NEIGHBORS ARE OUTRAGED. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Bealer: PAYING THE AMOUNT OF RENT THAT I PAY HERE, I WOULD EXPECT THAT THAT WOULD BE AN AMENITY INCLUDED. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Gutierrez: ALSO SWAMPED, COLLEGE CAMPUSES WHERE STUDENTS ARE BUYING MORE TEXTBOOKS ONLINE. MANY MAIL ROOMS NOW OFFER E-MAIL OR TEXT ALERTS. OTHERS ARE INSTALLING LOCKERS WITH KEY PADS. UPS IS EXPANDING TO 100 CITIES A PROGRAM THAT ALLOWS CUSTOMERS TO PICK UP THEIR PACKAGES AT ALTERNATE BUSINESSES WHICH MAY STAY OPEN LATER. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Thomas: IT&#65533;S MORE WORK, BUT IT IS GOOD FOR ALL OF IS. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Gutierrez: AND GEOVANY THOMAS IS JUST GETTING STARTED. GABE GUITERREZ, NBC NEWS, ATLANTA. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Holt: UP NEXT TONIGHT, THE SKY MAY NOT BE BIG ENOUGH FOR BOTH OF THEM. A TOO CLOSE FOR COMFORT ENCOUNTER BETWEEN U.S. AND RUSSIAN AIRCRAFT CAUGHT ON CAMERA. A TERRIBLE TRAGEDY IN FRANCE WHERE AUTHORITIES SAY 43 PEOPLE ARE DEAD AFTER A BUS CARRYING RETIREES COLLIDED WITH A TRUCK IN THE COUNTRY&#65533;S SOUTHWESTERN WINE REGION. THEN FLAMES ENGULFED BOTH OF THE VEHICLES. EIGHT PEOPLE WERE ABLE TO ESCAPE. CAUGHT ON CAMERA, A DANGEROUSLY CLOSE ENCOUNTER IN THE SKIES OVER SYRIA. A SENIOR U.S. DEFENSE OFFICIAL ACKNOWLEDGES TO NBC NEWS THAT THIS VIDEO, TAKEN BY A RUSSIAN PILOT, SHOWS A RUSSIAN PLANE TAILING AN UNARMED U.S. SURVEILLANCE DRONE. WE&#65533;RE TOLD THERE HAD BEEN TWO SUCH ENCOUNTERS SINCE RUSSIA BEGAN AIRSTRIKES OVER SYRIA LAST MONTH, BUT NONE SINCE THE U.S. AND RUSSIA AGREED EARLIER THIS WEEK TO RULES FOR OPERATING IN SYRIAN AIR SPACE. AND IT IS ONLY OCTOBER, BUT THERE IS AN ALERT ABOUT YOUR THANKSGIVING TURKEY. THERE WILL BE FEWER OF THEM TO GO AROUND THIS YEAR. THE GOVERNMENT SAYS THAT&#65533;S BECAUSE OF A BIRD FLU OUTBREAK THAT WIPED OUT 9 MILLION OF THEM. THEY&#65533;RE NOT CALLING IT A SHORTAGE. THERE WILL STILL BE TURKEYS, BUT YOU MIGHT HAVE TO PAY A BIT MORE THAN USUAL. WHEN WE COME BACK, A ONE-OF-A-KIND THEATER EXPERIENCE. WHY IT MEANS SO MUCH TO THE KIDS INVITED TO GET INTO THE ACT. FINALLY TONIGHT, IT&#65533;S ONE OF THE HOTTEST TICKETS IN TOWN FOR A THEATER EXPERIENCE UNLIKE ANY ANOTHER. NBC&#65533;s ANNE THOMPSON TELLS US ABOUT AN INCREDIBLE SHOW THAT&#65533;S MAKING A DIFFERENCE BY GOING THE EXTRA MILE TO BREAK THROUGH TO THE KIDS IN THE AUDIENCE. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; All: UP AND AWAY! &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Thompson: EIGHT TIMES A WEEK, EIGHT LUCKY CHILDREN LIFT OFF FROM LINCOLN CENTER WITH THE FOG FAMILY, TRAVELING IN FOUR HOT AIR BALLOONS WITHOUT EVER LEAVING THE GROUND. THE TRIP IS THE PRODUCTION OF THE TRUSTY SIDEKICK THEATER GROUP AND THE AUTISTIC CHILDREN FOR WHOM IT IS CREATED. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Chapman: DURING THE PERFORMANCE, I&#65533;M LOOKING AROUND THE ROOM, AND THERE ARE EIGHT SHOWS HAPPENING WITH EACH OF THESE KIDS, MOMENTS THAT I FEEL LIKE WE&#65533;RE UNLOCKING SOMETHING, A DOOR THAT MIGHT NOT HAVE BEEN OPENED BEFORE. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Thompson: FOR THIS AUDIENCE, PLANNING FOR THE TRIP BEGAN WEEKS BEFORE AT THEIR SCHOOL IN EASTCHESTER, NEW YORK... &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; All: UP AND AWAY! &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Thompson: ...INTRODUCING THEM TO THE STORY LINE, THE MUSIC, AND SOME OF THE ACTORS. ALL TEACHING ARTISTS WHO, ON THE DAY OF THE PERFORMANCE, ARE BOTH CHARACTERS AND COMPANIONS. DOES IT TAKE MORE THAN YOUR TYPICAL THEATRICAL PRODUCTION? &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Marie: I THINK IT IS A GREAT EXPERIMENT TO TAKE ON BECAUSE YOU ACTUALLY REALLY AND TRULY HAVE TO FOSTER A ONE-ON-ONE CONNECTION WITH SOMEONE, AND IT IT HAS TO BE HONEST. IT CAN&#65533;T BE MANUFACTURED. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Thompson: THE SHOW HAS ELEMENTS TO MAKE CHILDREN ON THE SPECTRUM FEEL SECURE. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Man: ...FISH BACK IN THE BATHTUB. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Thompson: STRUCTURE, REPETITION... &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; All: HOLD ON TIGHT! [ SOFT CHIMING ] &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Thompson: ...SOFT LIGHTING AND SOUNDS, USING DIFFERENT SENSES TO TELL THE STORY AND BUILD TRUST. FOR PARENTS, IT&#65533;S A RARE MOMENT TO RELAX. HERE, LINDA FAIR SAYS HER DAUGHTER KIMBERLY&#65533;S ENTHUSIASM IS ACCEPTED. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Fair: IT&#65533;S SO NICE TO GO SOMEPLACE... WHERE YOU&#65533;RE WELCOME. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Thompson: LINCOLN CENTER EDUCATION, WHICH COMMISSIONED THE MUSICAL, HOPES IT IS A CATALYST. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Granet: IF THEATERS THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY COULD BEGIN TO CREATE AND COMMISSION THEATER FOR THIS AUDIENCE, I THINK IT COULD BE A GAME-CHANGER. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Thompson: A TRANSFORMATIVE EXPERIENCE SHOWING THIS AUDIENCE THE SKY IS THE LIMIT. ANNE THOMPSON, NBC NEWS, NEW YORK. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Holt: THAT WILL DO IT FOR US ON THIS FRIDAY NIGHT. I HOPE YOU&#65533;LL JOIN ME LATER TONIGHT FOR &quot;DATELINE&quot; -- A STORY WE&#65533;VE BEEN FOLLOWING FOR YEARS ABOUT A NOTORIOUS MURDER, A MAN CONVICTED OF TAKING PART IN THE CRIME, AND, FOR 25 YEARS, FIGHTING FOR HIS FREEDOM WHILE PROCLAIMING HIS INNOCENCE. THAT&#65533;S &quot;DATELINE&quot; AT 9:00, 8:00 CENTRAL. I&#65533;M LESTER HOLT. FOR ALL OF US AT NBC NEWS, THANK YOU FOR WATCHING, AND GOOD NIGHT.","smpte-tt":"http://videocaptions.nbcnews.com/smpte-tt/nn_netcast_151023.tt","srt":"http://videocaptions.nbcnews.com/srt/nn_netcast_151023.srt","web-vtt":"http://videocaptions.nbcnews.com/web-vtt/nn_netcast_151023.vtt"}},"sections":[{"title":"News","slug":"news"}],"topics":[{"title":"News","slug":"news"}],"externalSource":"WorkBench","taxons":[{"slug":"news","type":"Section","title":"News","topics":[]}],"broadcastDate":"Fri, Oct 23","playlistSlug":"full-broadcast"},{"video":{"type":"","widget_type":"","videoType":"Broadcast","mpxId":"549861955980","guid":"nn_netcast_151022","pubDate":"2015-10-23 01:50:00 Z","expirationDate":"2113-04-11 01:50:00 Z","playbackIsDisabled":false,"availabilityState":"available","title":"Nightly News Full Broadcast (October 22nd)","description":"In Thursday night's broadcast: Hillary Clinton's Benghazi hearing, an American dies in combat in Iraq, and a warning about hands free technology in the car.","thumbnail":"http://media2.s-nbcnews.com/i/MSNBC/Components/Video/__NEW/nn_netcast_151022.jpg","source":"Nightly News Netcast","sourceId":null,"canonicalUrl":"http://www.nbcnews.com/nightly-news-netcast/video/nightly-news-full-broadcast-october-22nd-549861955980","shortUrl":"http://nbcnews.to/1kxS2wy","associatedPlaylistUrl":"http://feed.theplatform.com/f/2E2eJC/nnd_18424748","fallbackPlaylistUrl":null,"topVideosPlaylistUrl":"http://feed.theplatform.com/f/2E2eJC/nnd_20381145","mezzVersion":"2","embedUrl":"http://player.theplatform.com/p/2E2eJC/nbcNewsOffsite?guid=nn_netcast_151022","videoAssets":[{"format":"ISM","assetType":"Smooth_1","publicUrl":"http://link.theplatform.com/s/2E2eJC/IqgCPiyXc4ex","width":"1464","height":"824","bitRate":"3763968","privateUrl":null,"duration":"1224.666","durationISO":"PT20M24.666S"},{"format":"QT","assetType":"Mezzanine Video","publicUrl":"http://link.theplatform.com/s/2E2eJC/AfMrbzkq0etH","width":"0","height":"0","bitRate":"6000000","privateUrl":null,"duration":"1224","durationISO":"PT20M24S"},{"format":"MPEG4","assetType":"Limelight MP4","publicUrl":"http://link.theplatform.com/s/2E2eJC/0GIp0cVJJnyS","width":"640","height":"360","bitRate":"800000","privateUrl":null,"duration":"1224","durationISO":"PT20M24S"},{"format":"MPEG4","assetType":"Limelight MP4","publicUrl":"http://link.theplatform.com/s/2E2eJC/xJPZR1LaZmDB","width":"420","height":"240","bitRate":"500000","privateUrl":null,"duration":"1224","durationISO":"PT20M24S"},{"format":"MPEG4","assetType":"FireTV-Once","publicUrl":"http://link.theplatform.com/s/2E2eJC/ktLKRHcAQqKc","width":"0","height":"0","bitRate":"0","privateUrl":null,"duration":"1224","durationISO":"PT20M24S"},{"format":"MPEG4","assetType":"OnceURL","publicUrl":"http://link.theplatform.com/s/2E2eJC/su72HlmweObS","width":"0","height":"0","bitRate":"0","privateUrl":null,"duration":"1224","durationISO":"PT20M24S"}],"video_playlists":[{"playlist_id":"nnd_18424748","label":null}],"nativeVideo":false,"autoPlay":false,"defaultAssociation":"NBC News/Sections/Nightly Netcast","duration":1224,"hasCaption":true,"durationISO":"PT20M24.666S","captionLinks":{"requiresCaptioning":"True","clean":"&gt;&gt; Holt: TONIGHT, IN THE HOT SEAT -- HILLARY CLINTON GRILLED FOR HOURS ON THE BENGHAZI ATTACKS THAT KILLED FOUR AMERICANS, APPEARING CALM EVEN AS TEMPERS ERUPTED.

FORMER SECRETARY OF STATE HILLARY CLINTON HAS STOOD HER GROUND IN THE FACE OF WITHERING REPUBLICAN QUESTIONING OVER HER HANDLING OF THE CONSULATE ATTACK THAT KILLED FOUR AMERICANS IN BENGHAZI, LIBYA, DURING HER WATCH THREE YEARS AGO. HER ANSWERS, HER TONE, HER EXPRESSIONS ALL UNDER THE MICROSCOPE BECAUSE AS MUCH AS IT IS SECRETARY CLINTON TESTIFYING BEFORE THE HOUSE BENGHAZI COMMITTEE, IT IS PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE CLINTON WHO STANDS THE MOST TO LOSE IN A TESTY AND POLITICALLY-CHARGED SHOWDOWN THAT HAS CONTINUED INTO THE EVENING. ANDREA MITCHELL IS COVERING IT FOR US TONIGHT. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Mitchell: IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE ABOUT BENGHAZI, BUT IT SOON DISSOLVED INTO BICKERING. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Gowdy: I DON&#65533;T CARE IF YOU SENT IT BY MORSE CODE, CARRIER PIGEON, SMOKE SIGNALS. WHAT IS RELEVANT IS THAT HE WAS SENDING INFORMATION TO THE SECRETARY OF STATE. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Cummings: WOULD THE GENTLEMAN YIELD? &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Gowdy: I&#65533;D BE HAPPY TO, BUT YOU NEED TO MAKE SURE THE ENTIRE RECORD IS CORRECT. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Cummings: AND THAT&#65533;S EXACTLY WHAT I WANT TO DO. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Gowdy: WELL, THEN GO AHEAD. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Mitchell: WHILE THEY ARGUED, THE STAR WITNESS TRIED TO STAY ABOVE THE FRAY UNLIKE IN 2013. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Clinton: WHAT DIFFERENCE AT THIS POINT DOES IT MAKE? &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Mitchell: THIS TIME, HILLARY CLINTON WAS POISED, PRACTICED, PUSHING BACK WITH PUTDOWNS. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Clinton: I WROTE A WHOLE CHAPTER ABOUT THIS IN MY BOOK, &quot;HARD CHOICES.&quot; I WOULD BE GLAD TO SEND IT TO YOU, CONGRESSMAN. I&#65533;M SORRY THAT IT DOESN&#65533;T FIT YOUR NARRATIVE, CONGRESSMAN. I CAN ONLY TELL YOU WHAT THE FACTS WERE. I KNOW THAT&#65533;S NOT THE ANSWER YOU WANT TO HEAR. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Mitchell: AT OTHER TIMES, HER FACE SAID IT ALL, LAUGHING OFF UNWELCOME SUGGESTIONS, SHOWING IMPATIENCE, IRRITATION, OR SCORN, REFLECTING DAYS OF PREPARATION AT HOME, SENT OFF TO BATTLE THIS MORNING BY HER HUSBAND BILL. THE REPUBLICANS WERE ALSO ARMED AND READY. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Pompeo: HAPPY TO BRING BREAKFAST IN, BUT IT WOULD SURE BE HELPFUL IF WE COULD GET TO THE ANSWER. IT WASN&#65533;T A TRICK QUESTION AT ALL. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Roskam: THEY WERE CONCERNED, THAT IS, THE WHITE HOUSE, THAT THE AMOUNT OF CREDIT THAT YOU WERE GETTING AS OPPOSED TO THE AMOUNT OF CREDIT THE PRESIDENT&#65533;S GETTING. THAT&#65533;S TRUE, ISN&#65533;T IT, MADAM SECRETARY? &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Clinton: LOOK, THE PRESIDENT DESERVES THE LION&#65533;S SHARE OF THE CREDIT. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Roskam: THEN WHY IS THE WHITE HOUSE UPTIGHT THAT YOU&#65533;RE TAKING THE CREDIT? &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Mitchell: AT A FIERCE DISPUTE OVER A CONTROVERSIAL FORMER CLINTON POLITICAL AIDE SYDNEY BLUMENTHAL, BARRED BY THE OBAMA WHITE HOUSE FROM WORKING AT HER STATE DEPARTMENT, BUT SENDING PRIVATE ADVICE ABOUT LIBYA TO HER PRIVATE E-MAIL ACCOUNT. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Gowdy: MADAM SECRETARY, HE HAD UNFETTERED ACCESS TO YOU. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Clinton: I DON&#65533;T KNOW WHAT THIS LINE OF QUESTIONING DOES TO HELP US GET TO THE BOTTOM OF THE DEATHS OF FOUR AMERICANS. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Gowdy: I&#65533;LL BE HAPPY TO HELP YOU UNDERSTAND THAT, MADAM SECRETARY. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Mitchell: IT WAS CLINTON WHO SPENT THE MOST TIME TALKING ABOUT THE VICTIMS OF THE ATTACK. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Clinton: YOU KNOW, I WOULD IMAGINE I THOUGHT MORE ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED THAN ALL OF YOU PUT TOGETHER. I&#65533;VE LOST MORE SLEEP THAN ALL OF YOU PUT TOGETHER. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Mitchell: INFORMATION OFFICER AND AIR FORCE VETERAN SEAN SMITH, CIA OFFICERS TYRONE WOODS AND GLEN DOHERTY, AND AMBASSADOR CHRIS STEVENS. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Clinton: I STOOD NEXT TO PRESIDENT OBAMA AS MARINES CARRIED HIS CASKET AND THOSE OF THE OTHER THREE AMERICANS OFF THE PLANE AT ANDREWS AIR FORCE BASE. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Mitchell: CLINTON HAS BEEN HERE NOW ALL DAY INTO THE NIGHT, TESTIFYING SHE NEVER RECEIVED A REQUEST FOR MORE SECURITY FROM CHRIS STEVENS, ALTHOUGH THE AMBASSADOR MADE THOSE REQUESTS, HUNDREDS OF THEM, TO SECURITY OFFICIALS. BUT FOR ALL THE TALK ABOUT HILLARY CLINTON&#65533;S E-MAILS, SHE SAID SHE DID MOST OF HER BUSINESS OFFLINE IN CLASSIFIED BRIEFINGS AND DIDN&#65533;T EVEN HAVE A COMPUTER IN HER STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICE. LESTER? &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Holt: ANDREA MITCHELL ON CAPITOL HILL. LET&#65533;S TURN TO OUR POLITICAL DIRECTOR, THE MODERATOR OF &quot;MEET THE PRESS,&quot; CHUCK TODD. CHUCK, ASSUMING NO BOMBSHELLS EMERGE GOING FORWARD, DOES BENGHAZI STILL REMAIN A POTENT CAMPAIGN ISSUE AGAINST HER DEEP INTO 2016? &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Todd: WELL, LOOK, IT&#65533;S A POTENT ISSUE WITH THE REPUBLICAN ELECTORATE IN THE REPUBLICAN PRIMARY. SO IT IS NOT GOING TO GO AWAY IN REPUBLICAN CIRCLES, BUT AS A GENERAL ELECTION ISSUE FOR HILLARY CLINTON, BENGHAZI, IT&#65533;S HARD TO SEE THAT TODAY SOMEHOW CHANGED MINDS IN A NEGATIVE WAY FOR HILLARY CLINTON. IF ANYTHING, YOU HAVE PLENTY OF DEMOCRATS WHO FEEL BETTER ABOUT HILLARY CLINTON TODAY THAN THEY DID YESTERDAY, WHO, OF COURSE, FELT BETTER ABOUT HER YESTERDAY THANKS TO JOE BIDEN, THANKS TO HER DEBATE PERFORMANCE. SO AS PERFORMANCE ART, I THINK PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE HILLARY CLINTON&#65533;S HAD A GOOD DAY. BUT THERE HAS BEEN AN AWFUL LOT OF DEFLECTION, LESTER. AND I DO THINK THE ISSUE, THE LARGER ISSUE OF LIBYA POLICY, THE LARGER ISSUE OF THE DECISIONS SHE MADE AND PARTICIPATED IN WHEN IT CAME TO DEALING WITH THE ARAB SPRING AND EVERYTHING THAT LED TO THAT MOMENT IS STILL GOING TO BE A RELEVANT TOPIC AND A TOUGH THING FOR HER TO DEFEND DURING A POTENTIAL GENERAL ELECTION FOR HER. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Holt: ALL RIGHT, CHUCK TODD, APPRECIATE YOUR ANALYSIS. OVERSEAS NOW, AN AMERICAN SOLDIER HAS BEEN KILLED IN IRAQ IN COMBAT FOR THE FIRST TIME IN FOUR YEARS. IT HAPPENED DURING A HOSTAGE RESCUE MISSION CARRIED OUT WITH KURDISH FORCES, A KEY U.S. ALLY IN THE FIGHT AGAINST ISIS. IN A STATEMENT, ISIS DISMISSED THE RAID AS A FAILURE, BUT THE PENTAGON IS CALLING IT A BIG SUCCESS DESPITE THE LOSS OF LIFE. OUR CHIEF FOREIGN CORRESPONDENT RICHARD ENGEL HAS THE DRAMATIC DETAILS. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Engel: THE RAID WAS SUPPOSED TO RESCUE KURDISH HOSTAGES LIKE THESE HELD BY ISIS IN CAGES. U.S. INTELLIGENCE HAD LEARNED THEY WERE ABOUT TO BE EXECUTED. SO WHEN THE KURDS, WASHINGTON&#65533;S CLOSEST ALLIES IN IRAQ, ASKED FOR HELP RESCUING THEM, U.S. FORCES AGREED. AT 2:00 A.M., AMERICAN SPECIAL OPS AND KURDISH FORCES IN FIVE U.S. HELICOPTERS HEADED FOR THE TOWN OF HAWIJA, LANDING NEAR AN ISIS PRISON ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF TOWN. SOURCES SAY ISIS HAD ALREADY DUG MASS GRAVES FOR THEIR HOSTAGES. KURDISH TROOPS STORMED IN. ABOUT 20 ISIS GUARDS INSIDE FOUGHT BACK. SO THE U.S. TROOPS, THERE TO ASSIST, GUARD THE PERIMETER, AND COMMUNICATE WITH U.S. AIRCRAFT ABOVE, DECIDED TO STEP IN TO PROTECT, THE PENTAGON SAYS, THEIR KURDISH ALLIES AND THE HOSTAGES. ABOUT 15 ISIS GUARDS WERE KILLED, BUT NOT BEFORE, THE U.S. MILITARY SAYS, AN ISIS FIGHTER SHOT ONE AMERICAN COMMANDO, SO FAR UNIDENTIFIED, WHO LATER DIED OF HIS INJURIES. THE FIRST AMERICAN TO DIE IN COMBAT IN IRAQ SINCE U.S. FORCES WITHDREW FOUR YEARS AGO. BUT THE PENTAGON INSISTS THIS WAS A UNIQUE SITUATION. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Cook: U.S. FORCES ARE NOT IN AN ACTIVE COMBAT MISSION IN IRAQ. AND I CAN SAY THAT DIRECTLY. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Engel: WHEN THE FIGHT WAS OVER, THE AMERICANS AND KURDS LOADED THE FREED HOSTAGES, 75 OF THEM ACCORDING TO U.S. OFFICIALS, AND AT LEAST FIVE CAPTURED ISIS GUARDS ON THE HELICOPTERS AND LEFT. THE HOSTAGES TURNED OUT NOT TO BE KURDS. AROUND 20 WERE KIDNAPPED IRAQI SECURITY FORCES, OTHERS INCLUDED SO-CALLED ISIS DEFECTORS. STILL, THE U.S. MILITARY IS CALLING THE RAID A HUGE SUCCESS BECAUSE OF THE NUMBER OF LIVES SAVED IN ONE OF THE BIGGEST HOSTAGE RESCUES ANYWHERE IN RECENT MEMORY. BUT THE OPERATION ALSO SHOWS THAT U.S. FORCES ARE DOING A LOT MORE THAN JUST ADVISING IN THE WAR ON ISIS. IN THIS CASE, THEY WERE IN CLOSE COMBAT, HAD TO COME TO THE AID OF THEIR ALLIES AT THE COST OF ONE AMERICAN LIFE. LESTER? &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Holt: RICHARD ENGEL TONIGHT, THANKS. THERE ARE NEW DEVELOPMENTS IN THE ROAD RAGE SHOOTING OF A 4-YEAR-OLD GIRL IN ALBUQUERQUE, NEW MEXICO. THE SUSPECT APPEARING IN COURT LATE TODAY AFTER POLICE SAY HE CONFESSED TO THE CRIME. AND TONIGHT, THE YOUNG VICTIM&#65533;S FAMILY IS SPEAKING OUT ABOUT THEIR LOSS TO NBC NEWS NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT MIGUEL ALMAGUER. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Almaguer: FACING A JUDGE ON CLOSED-CIRCUIT TELEVISION... &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Schultz: THIS IS POSSIBLY ONE OF THE MOST WANTON AND ATROCIOUS ACTS, AS ALLEGED, I THINK, IN THE HISTORY OF THIS CITY. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Almaguer: 32-YEAR-OLD TONY TORRES DIDN&#65533;T ENTER A PLEA, THOUGH POLICE SAY HE&#65533;S CONFESSED TO THE ROAD RAGE MURDER 4-YEAR-OLD ILLIANA GARCIA, SHOT IN THE HEAD AS HER FATHER DROVE HER HOME FROM SCHOOL. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Woman: HE TOOK MY ILLIANA. YOU KNOW, SHE IS NOT GOING TO FIRST GRADE. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Almaguer: SPEAKING IN-DEPTH FOR THE FIRST TIME, ALAN GARCIA SAYS DETECTIVES HAVE ASKED HIM NOT TO TALK ABOUT THE SHOOTING, WHAT WITNESSES DESCRIBE AS TWO DRIVERS YELLING AT ONE ANOTHER ALONG I-40 IN ALBUQUERQUE. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Alan: WHEN SOMEONE CUTS YOU OFF AND YOU HONK AT THEM -- AND EVERYBODY&#65533;S DONE IT. EVERYBODY SAYS SOMETHING UNDER THEIR BREATH. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Woman: HE MADE A CHOICE TO PULL OUT HIS GUN. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Almaguer: LILY LOVED MUSIC NEARLY AS MUCH AS SHE LOVED HER BIG BROTHER. AND ON THAT DRIVE HOME, SHE ASKED TO SIT NEXT TO ISAAC. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Alan: THERE&#65533;S SO MANY WHAT-IFS. IF I WOULD HAVE LET HER MOVE HER SEAT OVER SIX INCHES. SIX INCHES. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Almaguer: IN THEIR GRIEF, THE GARCIAS ARE ALSO GRATEFUL. FIRST RESPONDERS DID ALL THEY COULD. ISAAC STILL WEARS THE COAT A FIREMAN TOOK OFF HIS OWN BACK. TONIGHT, THIS FAMILY HOPES THERE ARE LESSONS IN THEIR LOSS. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Woman: SHE WAS JUST A BEAUTIFUL, BEAUTIFUL SOUL. AND FROM THIS TRAGEDY, I WANT SOMETHING POSITIVE TO COME OUT OF IT. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Almaguer: WITH SO MANY TOUCHED BY THIS TRAGEDY, NEARLY $70,000 HAS BEEN RAISED BY STRANGERS FOR THE GARCIA FAMILY SO THEY CAN BURY 4-YEAR-OLD LILLY. AS FOR TONY TORRES, POLICE SAY EARLIER TODAY IN HIS HOME, THEY FOUND BOTH THE SUSPECTED GETAWAY CAR AND THE GUN USED IN TUESDAY&#65533;S SHOOTING. LESTER? &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Holt: ALL RIGHT, MIGUEL, THANK YOU. A MYSTERY TONIGHT IN ST. LOUIS WHERE SEVEN CHURCHES HAVE NOW BEEN SET ON FIRE IN JUST OVER TWO WEEKS. THE LATEST IN A STRING OF ARSONS WAS DISCOVERED EARLY THIS MORNING AT A CHURCH WITH A MOSTLY WHITE CONGREGATION. THE OTHERS HAVE HAPPENED IN LARGELY AFRICAN-AMERICAN NEIGHBORHOODS. IN ALL THE CASES, THE DOOR OF THE CHURCHES WERE IGNITED. SO FAR, NO INJURIES HAVE BEEN REPORTED. RIGHT NOW, WE ARE MONITORING TWO MAJOR WEATHER SYSTEMS CLOSING IN. ONE IS A TORRENTIAL RAIN MAKER SWEEPING INTO THE SOUTH CENTRAL U.S., BRINGING POTENTIALLY LIFE-THREATENING FLOODING. 10 MILLION PEOPLE UNDER FLASH FLOOD WATCHES ALREADY. THE OTHER SYSTEM IS A FEROCIOUS CATEGORY 4 HURRICANE ABOUT TO SLAM INTO MEXICO, AND THE DAMAGE COULD BE CATASTROPHIC. AL ROKER IS TRACKING BOTH STORMS. AL, THIS DOESN&#65533;T SOUND GOOD AT ALL. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Roker: IT REALLY DOESN&#65533;T, LESTER, AND ONE IMPACTS ON THE OTHER. WE&#65533;VE GOT THIS HURRICANE PATRICIA THAT&#65533;S GOING TO MAKE LANDFALL SOMETIME FRIDAY EVENING. AND IT&#65533;S GOING TO WEAKEN OVER THE MOUNTAINS OF MEXICO, BUT BRING CATASTROPHIC FLOODING. THE OTHER PART IS THE REMNANTS OF THAT AND ITS MOISTURE IS GOING TO STREAM INTO TEXAS. WE ALREADY HAVE A SLIGHT RISK OF STRONG STORMS IN CENTRAL SOUTHERN TEXAS, ISOLATED WIND GUSTS 70 MILES PER HOUR. CAN&#65533;T RULE OUT TORNADOS TONIGHT. THEN WE ALSO HAVE FLASH FLOOD WATCHES ALREADY IN EFFECT INTO EARLY NEXT WEEK. THAT MOISTURE FROM THE GULF AND HURRICANE PATRICIA COMBINING TO CREATE CELLS THAT JUST SIT OVER CENTRAL TEXAS. TOMORROW, WE ARE LOOKING AT ABOUT A FIVE-INCH BULL&#65533;S-EYE BETWEEN AUSTIN AND WACO, TEXAS. THEN AS WE MOVE INTO SATURDAY, THE RAIN EXTENDS INTO SOUTHEASTERN TEXAS. THE HEAVY RAIN CONTINUES OVER CENTRAL TEXAS. WE&#65533;RE TALKING ANOTHER FIVE INCHES. BY THE TIME WE GET INTO TUESDAY, WE&#65533;RE TALKING AUSTIN, DALLAS, ALL THE WAY DOWN TO CORPUS CHRISTI, AS MUCH AS 12 INCHES OF RAIN. THIS IS GOING TO BE CATASTROPHIC FLOODING AND BEACH EROSION, AS WELL. COASTAL IMPACTS. WE&#65533;VE GOT COASTAL FLOOD WARNINGS AND WATCHES ALL THE WAY INTO LOUISIANA. LESTER, THERE IS GOING TO BE A LOT OF BEACH EROSION. THIS IS GOING TO BE SOMETHING WE ARE GOING TO BE TALKING ABOUT EARLY NEXT WEEK. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Holt: ALL RIGHT. AL, THANK YOU. WE SAID IT BEFORE AND AGAIN. THIS EVENING, WE ARE FOLLOWING DEVELOPMENTS OF A FRESH EMBARRASSMENT FOR THE U.S. SECRET SERVICE AS A NEW REPORT REVEALS AGENTS WERE FOUND SLEEPING AT THEIR POSTS WHILE ON THE JOB, INCLUDING ONE INCIDENT AT THE WHITE HOUSE. AND NBC&#65533;s CHRIS JANSING REPORTS THE AGENCY IS BEING WARNED THAT ITS EMPLOYEES ARE OVERWORKED, OVERTIRED, AND PUTTING SECURITY AT RISK. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Jansing: THE OFFICIAL ALERT SENT TO THE SECRET SERVICE IS BLUNT AND DIRECT. FINDING TWO OFFICERS WERE FOUND SLEEPING AT THEIR POSTS, DISCOVERED DURING INSPECTIONS PROMPTED BY THAT NOW-INFAMOUS INCIDENT WHEN A FENCE JUMPER GOT INTO THE WHITE HOUSE. INSPECTORS CONCLUDED THESE SAFETY ISSUES POST AN IMMEDIATE OR POTENTIAL DANGER TO U.S. SECRET SERVICE OFFICERS AND THOSE WHOM THEY PROTECT AND BLAMES FATIGUE FROM TRAVEL, OVERTIME SHIFTS, AND LONG HOURS. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Wackrow: WHEN YOU&#65533;RE A FEDERAL LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER WITH THE UNITED STATES SECRET SERVICE, YOU SHOULD BE OPERATING AT A MUCH HIGHER CALIBER THAN THIS. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Jansing: SECRET SERVICE RECORDS SHOW ONE AGENT WORKED ALMOST 60 HOURS OF OVERTIME BEFORE HE WAS CAUGHT SLEEPING. BUT AGENCY SOURCES SAY MUCH OF THAT OVERTIME WAS ON THE FLIGHT BACK FROM PRESIDENT OBAMA&#65533;S TRIP TO KENYA AND ISSUED A STATEMENT SAYING... THE CHAIRMAN OF THE HOUSE COMMITTEE THAT OVERSEES THE SERVICE, THOUGH, ISN&#65533;T BUYING THAT. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Chaffetz: THEIR STAFFING IS DOWN 10%, AND THEY ARE NOT ABLE TO FILL THAT VOID BECAUSE THE CULTURAL PROBLEMS ARE SO DEEP-SEATED, PEOPLE ARE LEAVING THE SECRET SERVICE. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Jansing: THIS IS THE LATEST IN A STRING OF EMBARRASSING EPISODES, INCLUDING AGENTS RUNNING A WHITE HOUSE SECURITY BARRIER AFTER DRINKING. TONIGHT THE WHITE HOUSE IS BACKING THE AGENCY AND ITS DIRECTOR. BUT JOE CLANCY WAS ALREADY SCHEDULED TO TESTIFY BEFORE CONGRESS NEXT WEEK. NOW HE&#65533;LL HAVE EVEN MORE QUESTIONS TO ANSWER. CHRIS JANSING, NBC NEWS, THE WHITE HOUSE. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Holt: AND WE HAVE SOME BREAKING NEWS FROM WASHINGTON. THE DRAMA MAY SOON BE OVER IN THE SEARCH FOR A NEW SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE AS CONGRESSMAN PAUL RYAN HAS OFFICIALLY JUMPED IN THE RACE, FEELING HE HAS ENOUGH SUPPORT FROM THE REPUBLICAN CAUCUS AND HIS CONDITIONS APPARENTLY SATISFIED. RYAN DECLARED HIS CANDIDACY MOMENTS AGO IN A LETTER TO COLLEAGUES. THE VOTE FOR A NEW SPEAKER WILL TAKE PLACE NEXT WEEK. STILL AHEAD AS WE CONTINUE HERE TONIGHT, A NEW WARNING FOR DRIVERS WHO USE HANDS-FREE DEVICES. YOU MAY THINK ALL YOUR FOCUS IS ON THE ROAD AFTER YOU HANG UP A CALL OR CHANGE THE RADIO, BUT YOU MAY STILL BE DISTRACTED FOR A SURPRISING AND DANGEROUS AMOUNT OF TIME. ALSO, STAND AND DELIVER -- HOW SOME CLASSROOMS ARE DOING AWAY WITH OLD SCHOOL DESKS AND KEEPING KIDS ON THEIR TOES. WE ARE BACK WITH AN EYE-OPENING NEW LOOK AT THE DANGERS OF DISTRACTED DRIVING, WHICH KILLS MORE THAN 3,000 AMERICANS EACH YEAR. WE&#65533;VE ALL HEARD ABOUT THE DANGERS OF TALKING AND TEXTING WHILE DRIVING. MANY STATES NOW HAVE LAWS OUTLAWING IT UNLESS IT&#65533;S HANDS-FREE. BUT TONIGHT, RESEARCHERS ARE WARNING THAT HANDS-FREE DOESN&#65533;T MEAN RISK-FREE AS NBC&#65533;s STEPHANIE GOSK SHOWS US. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Gosk: NOT LONG AFTER DRIVERS STARTED USING CELLPHONES, THEY REALIZED JUST HOW DANGEROUS THAT CAN BE. HANDS-FREE LAWS WENT UP ALL OVER THE COUNTRY. BUT WHAT IF IT&#65533;S NOT JUST THE PHONE IN YOUR HAND THAT&#65533;S DANGEROUS? &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Woman: OKAY, GOOGLE. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Woman: WATCH OUT. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Man: CONTACT JOEL COOPER. OH! WHOA. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Gosk: A NEW STUDY CONDUCTED BY AAA AND THE UNIVERSITY OF UTAH SHOWS HANDS-FREE IS NOT AS RISK-FREE AS SOME THINK. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Strayer: OUR BRAINS AREN&#65533;T CONFIGURED TO MULTITASK WELL. AND SO THIS IS A SITUATION WHERE WE ARE ASKING OUR BRAINS TO DO THINGS, TRYING TO MULTITASK WHILE DRIVING, THAT WE JUST DON&#65533;T DO WELL. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Gosk: THE RESEARCH SHOWS THAT A DRIVER CAN REMAIN DISTRACTED FOR UP TO 27 SECONDS AFTER USING VOICE COMMAND TECHNOLOGY TO CHANGE MUSIC, SEND A TEXT, OR MAKE A PHONE CALL. NOW IN THIS NEIGHBORHOOD, FOR 27 SECONDS, I&#65533;M HITTING STOP SIGNS, I&#65533;VE GOT TO MAKE TURNS, HAVE TO AVOID PEOPLE ON BICYCLES. THE WHOLE TIME, ACCORDING TO THE STUDY, MY MIND IS ELSEWHERE. IN A STATEMENT, THE AUTO ALLIANCE SAID... &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Woman: OH, MY GOSH. I GUESS THAT IS A STOP SIGN. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Gosk: THE STUDY SHOWED OLDER DRIVERS STRUGGLE MORE THAN YOUNGER ONES WITH THE NEW TECHNOLOGY. AND THE BIGGEST DISTRACTIONS ARE WHEN IT DOESN&#65533;T QUITE WORK. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Woman: CALL ANNA TURNER. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Female voice: CALL HENRY BURNS. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Woman: NO, NO. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Gosk: BUT EVEN WHEN EVERYTHING WORKS PERFECTLY, RESEARCHERS SUGGEST USING HANDS-FREE DEVICES CAUTIOUSLY. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Strayer: JUST BECAUSE YOUR CAR LETS YOU DO IT DOESN&#65533;T MEAN IT&#65533;S SAFE TO DO IT. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Man: SIRI, PLAY THE BEATLES. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Gosk: AS AWFUL AS THIS MAY SOUND, SOMETIMES THE SONG, THE TEXT, OR THE CALL JUST HAS TO WAIT. STEPHANIE GOSK, NBC NEWS, FT. LEE, NEW JERSEY. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Holt: A LOT TO THINK ABOUT THERE. WE&#65533;RE BACK IN A MOMENT WITH A FOOD MANY OF YOU ENJOY SO MUCH, YOU MAY BE LITERALLY ADDICTED TO IT. IT GOES GREAT WITH CRACKERS, PIZZA WOULD BE NOTHING WITHOUT IT. BUT IF YOU EVER JOKED THAT YOU&#65533;RE ADDICTED TO CHEESE, YOU MAY ACTUALLY BE RIGHT. A NEW STUDY FINDS THAT A PROTEIN IN CHEESE CAN RELEASE OPIATES THAT TRIGGER DOPAMINE RECEPTORS IN OUR BRAIN LIKE CERTAIN DRUGS DO. SO NEXT TIME YOU GRAB AN EXTRA SLICE, BLAME SCIENCE. AND WE JUST HAD TO SHOW YOU THIS. THE MOST ADORABLE VIDEO OF THE DAY COMES FROM THE LOS ANGELES ZOO WHERE A BABY GIRAFFE MADE ITS PUBLIC DEBUT TODAY. DOESN&#65533;T HAVE A NAME YET, BUT HE&#65533;S ALREADY GOT QUITE A NECK. HE&#65533;S JUST UNDER 6 FEET TALL AND 130 POUNDS JUST TWO WEEKS AFTER HE WAS BORN. WHEN WE COME BACK, THE NEW TREND IN SCHOOLS THAT HAS STUDENTS STANDING AT ATTENTION. FINALLY TONIGHT, IT&#65533;S AN IDEA SOME SWEAR BY IN THE OFFICE. I&#65533;M DOING IT RIGHT NOW. BUT CAN IT WORK IN THE CLASSROOM? OUR JOE FRYER TAKES US TO A SCHOOL THAT&#65533;S SOLVING THE AGE-OLD PROBLEM OF GETTING KIDS TO SIT STILL AND PAY ATTENTION BY NOT HAVING THEM SIT AT ALL. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Woman: ARE YOU READY TO WRITE? &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Fryer: STUDENTS AT VALLECITO ELEMENTARY IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA ARE TAKING A STAND. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Girl I REALLY LIKE IT. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Fryer: SPENDING MUCH OF THE DAY ON THEIR FEET AT NEW STANDING DESKS. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Boy: I JUST FOCUS BETTER WHEN I&#65533;M STANDING. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Gray: THUMBS-UP IF YOU AGREE. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Fryer: TEACHERS LIKE AMANDA GRAY SAY THEY&#65533;RE SEEING A BIG DIFFERENCE. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Gray: I NOTICED THAT I CAN HOLD THEIR ATTENTION FOR LONGER BECAUSE I FEEL LIKE THEIR BRAINS AND THEIR BODIES ARE ACTIVE AND MORE AWAKE. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Fryer: FOR STUDENTS, IT&#65533;S LIKE A LESSON IN NEWTON&#65533;S FIRST LAW. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Girl: IT&#65533;S LIKE A BODY AT REST STAYS AT REST, BUT A BODY IN MOTION STAYS IN MOTION. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Fryer: AFTER TESTING THE IDEA IN A FEW CLASSROOMS LAST YEAR, THE SCHOOL DUMPED ALL OF ITS OLD-FASHIONED DESKS, REPLACING THEM WITH TALLER MODELS. EVEN THE PRINCIPAL HAS ONE. IF SOMEONE WALKS IN AND SAYS, &quot;WELL, KIDS SHOULDN&#65533;T BE STANDING ALL DAY,&quot; WHAT DO YOU SAY TO THAT? &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Smith: WE ACTUALLY DON&#65533;T HAVE THEM STANDING ALL DAY. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Fryer: STUDENTS CAN TAKE A SEAT WHENEVER THEY ARE FEELING TIRED, AND EVERY DESK HAS A FIDGET BAR TO KEEP KIDS MOVING. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Girl: IT RELEASES YOUR ENERGY, AND IT&#65533;S NOT HAVING YOU HUNCHED OVER. YOU&#65533;RE SITTING TALL. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Fryer: RESEARCHER JAMES LEVINE SAYS GETTING KIDS TO MOVE MORE DURING THE SCHOOL DAY ACTUALLY HELPS THEM IN THE CLASSROOM. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Levine: THEIR SCORES ARE BETTER, THEIR ATTENTION IS BETTER, THEIR SPECIFIC SKILL DEVELOPMENT IS BETTER. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Fryer: THE BIGGEST CHALLENGE -- COST. PARENTS IN VALLECITO RAISED $110,000 FOR NEW DESKS WITH HELP FROM JULIET STARRET&#65533;S ORGANIZATION STANDUP KIDS. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Starret: OUR MISSION IS TO GET THESE DESKS INTO AS MANY PUBLIC SCHOOLS AS WE CAN IN THE NEXT 10 YEARS, HOPEFULLY ALL OF THEM. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Fryer: STANDING DESKS ARE GRADUALLY POPPING UP IN CLASSROOMS AND OFFICES AROUND THE COUNTRY. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Boy: AND I THINK FOR CHRISTMAS, PEOPLE SHOULD START ASKING FOR THEM. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Fryer: A GROWING MOVEMENT FOR MORE MOVEMENT. JOE FRYER, NBC NEWS, SAN RAFAEL, CALIFORNIA. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Holt: I&#65533;M SUDDENLY FEELING VERY OLD SCHOOL AT THIS BIG DESK. THAT&#65533;S GOING TO DO IT FOR US ON THIS THURSDAY NIGHT. I&#65533;M LESTER HOLT. FOR ALL OF US AT NBC NEWS, THANK YOU FOR WATCHING, AND GOOD NIGHT.","smpte-tt":"http://videocaptions.nbcnews.com/smpte-tt/nn_netcast_151022.tt","srt":"http://videocaptions.nbcnews.com/srt/nn_netcast_151022.srt","web-vtt":"http://videocaptions.nbcnews.com/web-vtt/nn_netcast_151022.vtt"}},"sections":[{"title":"News","slug":"news"}],"topics":[{"title":"News","slug":"news"}],"externalSource":"WorkBench","taxons":[{"slug":"news","type":"Section","title":"News","topics":[]}],"broadcastDate":"Thu, Oct 22","playlistSlug":"full-broadcast"},{"video":{"type":"","widget_type":"","videoType":"Broadcast","mpxId":"549033027907","guid":"nn_netcast_151021","pubDate":"2015-10-22 01:36:00 Z","expirationDate":"2113-04-10 01:36:00 Z","playbackIsDisabled":false,"availabilityState":"available","title":"Nightly News Full Broadcast (October 21st)","description":"In Wednesday night's broadcast: what Biden's announcement means for 2016, what's in the CIA director's emails, and Paul Ryan sparks a work-life balance debate.","thumbnail":"http://media2.s-nbcnews.com/i/MSNBC/Components/Video/151021/nn_netcast_151021.jpg","source":"Nightly News Netcast","sourceId":null,"canonicalUrl":"http://www.nbcnews.com/nightly-news-netcast/video/nightly-news-full-broadcast-october-21st-549033027907","shortUrl":"http://nbcnews.to/1Rpno2E","associatedPlaylistUrl":"http://feed.theplatform.com/f/2E2eJC/nnd_18424748","fallbackPlaylistUrl":null,"topVideosPlaylistUrl":"http://feed.theplatform.com/f/2E2eJC/nnd_20381145","mezzVersion":"1","embedUrl":"http://player.theplatform.com/p/2E2eJC/nbcNewsOffsite?guid=nn_netcast_151021","videoAssets":[{"format":"MPEG4","assetType":"Limelight MP4","publicUrl":"http://link.theplatform.com/s/2E2eJC/_FsetS_p2UxP","width":"640","height":"360","bitRate":"800000","privateUrl":null,"duration":"1206","durationISO":"PT20M6S"},{"format":"QT","assetType":"Mezzanine Video","publicUrl":"http://link.theplatform.com/s/2E2eJC/BUQj5q8_0yMZ","width":"0","height":"0","bitRate":"6000000","privateUrl":null,"duration":"1206","durationISO":"PT20M6S"},{"format":"MPEG4","assetType":"Limelight MP4","publicUrl":"http://link.theplatform.com/s/2E2eJC/2G8Z0hifs_rM","width":"420","height":"240","bitRate":"500000","privateUrl":null,"duration":"1206","durationISO":"PT20M6S"},{"format":"ISM","assetType":"Smooth_1","publicUrl":"http://link.theplatform.com/s/2E2eJC/OkZ1sxD3oPRf","width":"1464","height":"824","bitRate":"3763968","privateUrl":null,"duration":"1206.4","durationISO":"PT20M6.4S"}],"video_playlists":[{"playlist_id":"nnd_18424748","label":null}],"nativeVideo":false,"autoPlay":false,"defaultAssociation":"NBC News/Sections/Nightly Netcast","duration":1206,"hasCaption":true,"durationISO":"PT20M6S","captionLinks":{"requiresCaptioning":"True","clean":"&gt;&gt; Holt: MAJOR POLITICAL NEWS TONIGHT. BIDEN WON&#65533;T RUN. THE VICE PRESIDENT FINALLY ENDS THE DRAMA AND SENDS A MESSAGE TO HILLARY CLINTON. WHAT IT MEANS FOR HER PATH TO THE PRESIDENCY WITH THE HIGH-STAKES BENGHAZI HEARING NOW HOURS AWAY. A SHOCKING ROAD RAGE ATTACK. A 4-YEAR-OLD GIRL SHOT DEAD WHILE RIDING WITH HER FAMILY. WHAT HAPPENED ON THAT STRETCH OF HIGHWAY? TONIGHT, WHAT WITNESSES SAW AS POLICE HUNT FOR A KILLER. THE CIA CHIEF&#65533;S E-MAILS STOLEN BY A HIGH SCHOOL HACKER AND NOW EXPOSED TO THE WORLD, INCLUDING WHAT HE TOLD THE PRESIDENT PRIVATELY ABOUT IRAN. AND BALANCING ACT FOR THE MAN BEING PRESSED TO TAKE ONE OF THE MOST POWERFUL JOBS IN AMERICA. HE SAYS IT HAS TO INCLUDE TIME FOR HIS KIDS, SPARKING A CONVERSATION ABOUT FATHERS AND FAMILY. &quot;NIGHTLY NEWS&quot; BEGINS RIGHT NOW. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Announcer: FROM NBC NEWS WORLD HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS IS &quot;NBC NIGHTLY NEWS&quot; WITH LESTER HOLT. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Holt: GOOD EVENING. HE&#65533;S FINALLY DECIDED, AND THE ANSWER IS &quot;NO.&quot; TODAY, VICE PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN OFFICIALLY CLOSED THE DOOR ON RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT, ENDING 82 DAYS OF PURE POLITICAL DRAMA AND FRAMING THE FINAL CHAPTER OF HIS LONG CAREER. BUT AS THAT DOOR CLOSED, ANOTHER MAY HAVE OPENED FOR HILLARY CLINTON. WHILE SHE TONIGHT IS THE OBVIOUS BENEFACTOR OF THE NEWS, IT DIDN&#65533;T COME WITHOUT HER BEING ON THE RECEIVING END OF ANOTHER VEILED SHOT BY THE V.P. OUR POLITICAL TEAM IS HERE. KRISTIN WELKER, WHO BROKE THE NEWS ON MONDAY THAT A BIDEN DECISION WOULD COME DOWN IN THE NEXT 48 HOURS LEADS OFF OUR COVERAGE TONIGHT FROM THE WHITE HOUSE. KRISTIN? &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Welker: LESTER, GOOD EVENING. JOE BIDEN DECLARED HE WON&#65533;T RUN, BUT MADE IT CLEAR HE DISAPPROVES OF HILLARY CLINTON&#65533;S SPLIT WITH PRESIDENT OBAMA ON ISSUES LIKE PACIFIC TRADE, HEALTH CARE, AND IMMIGRATION. HE DIDN&#65533;T ENDORSE ANYBODY, BUT HE DELIVERED A STRONG MESSAGE TO ALL THE DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATES. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Biden: I BELIEVE WE&#65533;RE OUT OF TIME. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Welker: AND WITH THOSE WORDS, VICE PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN CLOSED THE DOOR ON HIS LIFELONG GOAL OF RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT. AN EXTRAORDINARY MOMENT IN THE ROSE GARDEN, BOWING OUT BUT DELIVERING A CALL TO ACTION AND TAKING A SWIPE AT HILLARY CLINTON, WHO HAS MOVED AWAY FROM SOME OF OBAMA&#65533;S POLICIES. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Biden: THIS PARTY, OUR NATION, WILL BE MAKING A TRAGIC MISTAKE IF WE WALK AWAY OR ATTEMPT TO UNDO THE OBAMA LEGACY. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Welker: BIDEN, WHO MADE HIS DECISION LAST NIGHT, SAID THE GRIEVING PROCESS OVER HIS LATE SON BEAU WAS PIVOTAL. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Biden: I&#65533;VE SAID ALL ALONG WHAT I&#65533;VE SAID TIME AND AGAIN TO OTHERS -- THAT IT MAY VERY WELL BE THAT THAT PROCESS, BY THE TIME WE GET THROUGH IT, CLOSES THE WINDOW ON MOUNTING A REALISTIC CAMPAIGN FOR PRESIDENT, THAT IT MIGHT CLOSE. I&#65533;VE CONCLUDED IT HAS CLOSED. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Welker: BUT BIDEN SAID HE WON&#65533;T SIT ON THE SIDELINES. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Biden: BUT WHILE I WILL NOT BE A CANDIDATE, I WILL NOT BE SILENT. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Welker: CLINTON CALLED BIDEN AFTER HIS SPEECH AND TWEETED... THE BUZZ ABOUT BIDEN FIRST EMERGED IN AUGUST AS HILLARY CLINTON&#65533;S CAMPAIGN WAS FLOUNDERING WHEN THE NEW YORK TIMES REPORTED BEAU BIDEN, BEFORE HIS DEATH, HAS ENCOURAGED HIS FATHER TO RUN. BUT WITH HIS RECENT POLL NUMBERS DROPPING AND CLINTON&#65533;S STRONG DEBATE PERFORMANCE, PRESSURE FROM DEMOCRATS MOUNTED, PUTTING THE WHITE HOUSE IN AN INCREASINGLY AWKWARD POSITION. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Man: WHAT IS GOING ON? &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Earnest: WELL, AGAIN, YOU GUYS ARE THE ONES WHO CAN READ THE POLITICAL TEA LEAVES. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Welker: BIDEN RAN IN 1987 AND AGAIN IN 2008, UNSUCCESSFUL CAMPAIGNS MARRED BY MISSTEPS AND GAFFES. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Biden: YOU CANNOT GO TO A 7-ELEVEN OR A DUNKIN&#65533; DONUTS UNLESS YOU HAVE A SLIGHT INDIAN ACCENT. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Welker: AND TODAY IN THE ROSE GARDEN, IT WAS CLEAR BIDEN CAME TO THIS FINAL DECISION RELUCTANTLY, KNOWING, AT 72, THIS WAS LIKELY HIS LAST CHANCE. KRISTEN WELKER, NBC NEWS, THE WHITE HOUSE. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Biden: THANK YOU, ALL, VERY MUCH. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Mitchell: THIS IS ANDREA MITCHELL IN WASHINGTON. WITH JOE BIDEN OUT, THE DEMOCRATIC RACE OFFICIALLY BECOMES A TWO-PERSON SHOWDOWN BETWEEN HILLARY CLINTON AND BERNIE SANDERS. AND THAT&#65533;S GOOD NEWS FOR CLINTON. IN THE LATEST NBC NEWS/ WALL STREET JOURNAL POLL, CLINTON&#65533;S LEAD OVER SANDERS INCREASES BY FIVE POINTS WITHOUT BIDEN COMPETING FOR THE SAME VOTERS -- THE PARTY BASE, ESPECIALLY MINORITIES, AFRICAN-AMERICANS, AND LATINOS. A PRIMARY CONTEST BETWEEN CLINTON AND BIDEN WOULD HAVE SPLIT THE PARTY AND THE OBAMA WHITE HOUSE. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Rendell: IT WOULD HAVE HAD TO HAVE BEEN A SORT OF PERSONAL AND SOMEWHAT BITTER CAMPAIGN. THAT WOULD HAVE LEFT AN INJURED HILLARY CLINTON TO GO INTO THE FALL CAMPAIGN. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Mitchell: BIDEN STAYED CLEAR OF ANY ENDORSEMENT TODAY. INSTEAD TAKING A NOT-SO-SUBTLE JAB AT CLINTON&#65533;S COMMENT IN THE RECENT DEBATE THAT SHE&#65533;S PROUD TO CALL REPUBLICANS HER ENEMY. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Biden: THEY&#65533;RE NOT OUR ENEMIES. AND FOR THE SAKE OF THE COUNTRY, WE HAVE TO WORK TOGETHER. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Mitchell: BIDEN&#65533;S STRONGEST SUPPORTERS, LIKE THE FIREFIGHTERS, ARE STILL RELUCTANT TO BACK CLINTON. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Schaitberger: IF A MARRIAGE DOESN&#65533;T SEEM TO WORK, WE&#65533;RE NOT GOING TO JUST JUMP INTO ANOTHER MARRIAGE. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Mitchell: THE OTHER HURDLE -- TOMORROW&#65533;S BENGHAZI HEARING. CLINTON&#65533;S WASHINGTON HOME HAS BECOME A WAR ROOM WITH HUSBAND BILL, CAMPAIGN CHAIRMAN JOHN PODESTA, HER LAWYERS, AND FORMER AIDES. CLINTON&#65533;S GAME PLAN, UNLIKE LAST TIME -- &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Clinton: WHAT DIFFERENCE, AT THIS POINT, DOES IT MAKE? &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Mitchell: THIS TIME, SHE WILL TRY TO STAY COOL AND PLAY UP REPUBLICAN MISSTEPS. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Clinton: IT IS A PARTISAN VEHICLE AS ADMITTED BY THE HOUSE REPUBLICAN MAJORITY LEADER MR. McCARTHY, TO DRIVE DOWN MY POLL NUMBERS. BIG SURPRISE. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Mitchell: BUT THE BENGHAZI CONTROVERSY COULD STILL DRAG ON. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Man: WE ARE OVERRUN. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Mitchell: A MOVIE COMING SOON ALL BUT BLAMES CLINTON FOR THE TRAGEDY. A GRIEVING MOTHER WHOSE ONLY SON, SEAN SMITH, WAS AMONG THOSE KILLED ALSO BLAMES CLINTON. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Smith: IT WAS HER DEPARTMENT. HOW COME SHE LET MY SON BE KILLED? HOW COME? SHE KNEW THIS WAS HAPPENING. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Mitchell: AND I&#65533;M TOLD THAT CLINTON IS PLANNING TO TELL THE COMMITTEE THAT THE SLAIN AMBASSADOR CHRIS STEVENS WOULD NOT WANT TO PULL DIPLOMATS BACK FROM THE FRONT LINES. THE LESSON, SHE&#65533;LL SAY, IS TO MAKE THEM MORE SECURE. BUT 44% OF THE AMERICANS IN OUR NEW POLL SAY THEY ARE NOT SATISFIED BY CLINTON&#65533;S ANSWERS SO FAR ON BENGHAZI. THOSE PEOPLE ARE HER AUDIENCE TOMORROW, LESTER. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Holt: ANDREA. THANK YOU. THE ANNOUNCEMENT IMMEDIATELY ROCKETED ACROSS WASHINGTON AND FAR BEYOND THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL. THE REPUBLICAN FRONT-RUNNER DONALD TRUMP TWEETED... ...HE TWEETED. AND WITH THAT, LET&#65533;S BRING IN OUR POLITICAL DIRECTOR, THE MODERATOR OF &quot;MEET THE PRESS&quot; CHUCK TODD. CHUCK, LET&#65533;S PUT THIS IN PERSPECTIVE NOW. BERNIE SANDERS HAS DEFIED POLITICAL EXPECTATIONS. EVEN BEFORE SHE PUT HER HAT IN THE RING, HILLARY CLINTON WAS SEEN AS SOMEONE WHO -- THE NOMINATION WAS HERS TO LOSE. HOW DOES THE EQUATION CHANGE? &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Todd: WELL, I THINK THE EQUATION CHANGED SIMPLY RIGHT NOW IN THAT HAD JOE BIDEN GOTTEN IN, WE WOULD BE TALKING ABOUT BERNIE SANDERS AS THE FRONT-RUNNER IN IOWA AND NEW HAMPSHIRE OVER THE NEXT SIX MONTHS BECAUSE JUST AS ANDREA MITCHELL OUTLINED, IT WOULD HAVE SPLIT THE PARTY. BUT SANDERS SUPPORTERS ARE VERY DEVOTED. HE&#65533;S GOT A HARD CORE 35-40%, BUT THAT MAY BE HIS CEILING. IN A TWO-WAY RACE, 40% IS A WAY TO LOSE BY 20, IN A THREE-WAY RACE, 40% IS A WAY TO WIN. BUT LET&#65533;S LOOK AT THIS BIG PICTURE. WE MAY LOOK BACK. JULY, WE&#65533;RE GONNA BE IN PHILADELPHIA LOOKING AT THE DEMOCRATIC CONVENTION. AND IF SHE IS THE NOMINEE, WE&#65533;RE GONNA LOOK BACK AT THE 10-DAY PERIOD STARTING WITH THE DEMOCRATIC DEBATE, ENDING SATURDAY WITH THE JJ DINNER IN IOWA, BENGHAZI TESTIMONY, BIDEN GETTING OUT. WE MAY LOOK AT THIS 10-DAY PERIOD AS THE PERIOD THAT HILLARY CLINTON CLINCHED THE DEMOCRATIC NOMINATION. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Holt: COULD BE THE DEFINING PERIOD. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Todd: IT COULD ABSOLUTELY BE. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Holt: CHUCK, THANKS VERY MUCH. NOW TO TONIGHT&#65533;S OTHER MAJOR POLITICAL STORY. CONGRESSMAN PAUL RYAN, UNDER PRESSURE TO TAKE ONE OF THE MOST POWERFUL AND STRESSFUL POSITIONS IN THE COUNTRY. HE SAYS HE&#65533;LL DO IT, BUT ONLY IF HIS CONDITIONS ARE MET FIRST. NBC&#65533;s KELLY O&#65533;DONNELL JOINS US TONIGHT FROM CAPITOL HILL WITH MORE ON THAT. HI, KELLY. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; O&#65533;Donnell: GOOD EVENING, LESTER. CAPITOL HILL IN SUSPENSE TONIGHT. THE SEARCH FOR A NEW SPEAKER IN UNCHARTERED TERRITORY. A RELUCTANT CONGRESSMAN PAUL RYAN HAS SET CONDITIONS HE SAYS MUST BE MET IN ORDER FOR HIM TO TAKE THE POWERFUL TOP JOB. RYAN WANTS TO CHANGE HOUSE RULES TO MAKE IT HARDER TO FORCE OUT A FUTURE SPEAKER AND, MORE PERSONALLY, INSISTS ON GOING HOME ON WEEKENDS TO WISCONSIN TO BE WITH HIS SCHOOL-AGE CHILDREN AND NOT GO FUNDRAISING AROUND THE COUNTRY AS SPEAKER BOEHNER USUALLY DOES. RYAN SPENT TODAY MEETING WITH SMALL GROUPS OF CONSERVATIVES MOST RESISTANT TO BACKING HIM. THEY INCLUDE TEA PARTY REPUBLICANS WHO NOW CALL THEMSELVES &quot;THE FREEDOM CAUCUS.&quot; WITHOUT THEIR ENDORSEMENT, PAUL RYAN SAYS HE WON&#65533;T RUN. AND HE WANTS THEIR ANSWER BY FRIDAY. AND THE ELECTION FOR THE NEXT SPEAKER IS NEXT WEEK. SO THIS ALL COMES JUST AS CONGRESS IS STARING AT A DEADLINE TO INCREASE THE DEBT LIMIT, THE GOVERNMENT&#65533;S ABILITY TO BORROW. LESTER? &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Holt: ALL RIGHT, KELLY, THANK YOU. MORE E-MAIL TROUBLE TONIGHT FOR THE DIRECTOR OF THE CIA. THE WEBSITE WIKILEAKS IS SPILLING SOME OF THE CONTENTS FROM HIS PERSONAL ACCOUNT DAYS AFTER HACKERS BRAGGED ABOUT STEALING IT ON SOCIAL MEDIA. AS OUR JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT PETE WILLIAMS TELLS US, SOME OF THE DATA INCLUDES ADVICE THE CIA CHIEF GAVE THE PRESIDENT ON IRAN. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Williams: THROUGH TWITTER MESSAGES, THE HACKERS THEMSELVES LEFT BEHIND SOME OF THE BEST CLUES TO THEIR IDENTITY AS THE E-MAILS THEY STOLE SHOW UP ELSEWHERE. EXAMPLE -- IN A MEMO DRAFTED IN 2007, JOHN BRENNAN, THEN ADVISING THE OBAMA CAMPAIGN, RECOMMENDED THAT THE NEXT PRESIDENT TONE DOWN THE RHETORIC ON THE GOVERNMENT OF IRANIAN PRESIDENT AHMADINEJAD AND ESTABLISH A DIRECT DIALOGUE WITH IRAN. THAT&#65533;S AMONG DOCUMENTS PUBLISHED TONIGHT BY THE WEBSITE WIKILEAKS, STOLEN FROM BRENNAN&#65533;S PERSONAL AOL E-MAIL ACCOUNT BY HACKERS, INCLUDING ONE WHO CALLS HIMSELF &quot;CRACKA&quot; AND COMPARES HIMSELF TO NSA LEAKER EDWARD SNOWDEN, NOW EVADING U.S. CAPTURE IN MOSCOW. THE HACKER TWEETED... AND APPARENTLY FEARING IMMINENT ARREST, HE TWEETED... THE HACKERS HAD ALREADY REVEALED SOME OF BRENNAN&#65533;S E-MAILS, INCLUDING NAMES AND SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBERS OF SOME CURRENT AND FORMER INTELLIGENCE OFFICIALS AND CLAIM THEY GOT INTO A COMCAST ACCOUNT OF THE HOMELAND SECURITY SECRETARY JEH JOHNSON. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Johnson: THE ONE THING I&#65533;LL SAY IS DON&#65533;T BELIEVE EVERYTHING YOU READ IN THE NEWSPAPER BECAUSE A LOT OF IT IS INACCURATE. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Williams: THE HACKERS SAY THEY USED A PHONY VERIZON EMPLOYEE CODE TO TRICK VERIZON INTO REVEALING ENOUGH OF BRENNAN&#65533;S ACCOUNT INFORMATION TO RESET THE PASSWORD ON HIS AOL ACCOUNT AND TAKE IT OVER. COMPUTER SECURITY EXPERTS SAY THE CIA DIRECTOR OF ALL PEOPLE SHOULD HAVE KNOWN BETTER. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Tran: NEVER BANK ON SECURITY BEING 100% CERTAIN IN ANY WORLD WIDE WEB, ONLINE-BASED OPEN E-MAIL ACCOUNT. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Williams: LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS SAY TONIGHT THAT FINDING THE HACKERS HAS BECOME AN URGENT PRIORITY FOR THE FBI. AND THE CIA CONDEMNS WHAT IT CALLS THE MALICIOUS CRIME OF PLUNDERING THE ELECTRONIC HOLDINGS OF THE BRENNAN FAMILY. LESTER? &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Holt: PETE, THANK YOU. FOR ALMOST FIVE YEARS NOW, SYRIAN PRESIDENT ASSAD HAS HUNKERED DOWN IN DAMASCUS WHILE HIS COUNTRY DISINTEGRATED. SO IT CAME AS A SURPRISE TODAY TO SEE PICTURES OF HIM IN MOSCOW WITH VLADIMIR PUTIN. IT&#65533;S BEEN THREE WEEKS SINCE RUSSIA BEGAN AIRSTRIKES AGAINST ASSAD&#65533;S ENEMIES IN SYRIA. BUT AS CHIEF FOREIGN CORRESPONDENT RICHARD ENGEL TELLS US TONIGHT, THE MEETING IN MOSCOW WAS MORE THAN JUST A THANK YOU VISIT. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Engel: SYRIAN PRESIDENT ASSAD MADE A SURPRISE VISIT TO MOSCOW TO MEET WITH HIS DEFENDER, VLADIMIR PUTIN, HIS FIRST KNOWN TRIP ABROAD SINCE THE WAR BEGAN. HOW ASSAD TRAVELED WAS KEPT SECRET. THE TRIP REVEALED ONLY AFTER HE WAS BACK IN DAMASCUS. RUSSIA SEEMS TO WANT TO SHOW THE WORLD IT&#65533;S A SUPERPOWER ONCE MORE, RELEASING NEW FOOTAGE TODAY OF WHAT IT CLAIMS ARE MORE THAN 40 AIRSTRIKES OVER SYRIA IN THE PAST 24 HOURS. A LIFELINE FOR ASSAD. BUT RUSSIA MAY BE TRYING TO BROKER AN END TO THE CONFLICT. PUTIN SAYING MILITARY OPERATIONS WILL LAY THE BASE FOR A LONG-TERM POLITICAL SETTLEMENT. BUT AFTER A QUARTER MILLION DEAD, CAN ANY POLITICAL SOLUTION INCLUDE ASSAD? U.S. OFFICIALS TELL NBC NEWS THAT PUTIN MAY BE PROPPING UP ASSAD, ONLY TO TRANSITION HIM OUT LATER. WHATEVER THE MASTER PLAN, THIS WAR ALSO HAS A FRINGE BENEFIT FOR RUSSIA -- SHOWCASING ITS LATEST WEAPONS, ADVANCED CRUISE MISSILES, AND FIGHTER JETS. RUSSIA IS MILKING THE CONFLICT FOR EVERY DROP OF PROPAGANDA. STATE-CONTROLLED MEDIA BRAGS ABOUT RUSSIA&#65533;S MILITARY PROWESS, EVEN RELEASING DRAMATIC FOOTAGE FROM A DRONE FLYING LOW OVER BATTLEFIELDS NEAR DAMASCUS. PUTIN HAS BROUGHT RUSSIA TO THE FRONT LINES IN SYRIA AND WANTS THE WORLD TO KNOW IT MAYBE TO END THE WAR, MAYBE TO SELL WEAPONS, CERTAINLY TO GAIN AS MUCH PRESTIGE AS POSSIBLE. LESTER? &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Holt: RICHARD ENGEL TONIGHT. AND BACK HERE AT HOME, ANOTHER WILD DAY OF WEATHER IN THE SOUTHWEST AS HAIL BOMBARDED SOUTHERN NEW MEXICO, SOME OF IT AS BIG AS GOLF BALLS. STORMS HAVE BEEN WREAKING HAVOC IN THE REGION IN RECENT DAYS, AND THE RISK OF STRONG STORMS AND HEAVY RAIN CONTINUES TOMORROW INTO WEST TEXAS. 1 TO 4 INCHES OF RAIN ARE POSSIBLE. LATER IN THE WEEK, THE RISK OF FLOODING SHIFTS TO THE CENTRAL AND SOUTHEASTERN PART OF THE STATE. STILL AHEAD TONIGHT, A FATAL CASE OF SUSPECTED ROAD RAGE. A SHOOTING ON A BUSY HIGHWAY IN BROAD DAYLIGHT, LEAVING A 4-YEAR-OLD GIRL DEAD. AND NOW TONIGHT, A LATE DEVELOPMENT IN THE MANHUNT FOR THE PERSON WHO PULLED THE TRIGGER. ALSO, A WARNING ABOUT A POTENTIAL UNFORESEEN SIDE EFFECT IN THE ANTIBIOTICS SO MANY OF US GIVE OUR CHILDREN. THERE IS DEVELOPING NEWS IN THE STATE OF NEW MEXICO. A MANHUNT FOR A DRIVER WHO OPENED FIRE IN AN APPARENT ROAD-RAGE ATTACK ON THE HIGHWAY IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DAY, KILLING A 4-YEAR-OLD GIRL RIDING IN HER FAMILY&#65533;S CAR. AND WORD JUST IN THAT A PERSON OF INTEREST IN THAT SHOOTING HAS BEEN TAKEN INTO CUSTODY. NBC&#65533;s JACOB RASCON IS IN ALBUQUERQUE, A CITY IN SHOCK THIS EVENING. HE HAS LATE DETAILS. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Rascon: THE GUNMAN OPENED FIRE ON THIS RED DODGE PICKUP WITH THE GARCIA FAMILY INSIDE. THE VICTIM, 4-YEAR-OLD ILLIANA GARCIA, DIED AT THE HOSPITAL. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Eden: THIS IS A HORRIFIC TIME FOR THIS FAMILY -- THE TRAGIC LOSS OF LITTLE 4-YEAR-OLD LILLY WELL BEFORE HER TIME. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Rascon: INVESTIGATORS DON&#65533;T KNOW HOW IT STARTED, AND WITNESS ACCOUNTS DON&#65533;T ALL AGREE, BUT ONE WOMAN TELLS NBC NEWS THE RED PICKUP AND ANOTHER VEHICLE WERE DRIVING ERRATICALLY. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Tafoya: THE TRUCK WAS LITERALLY GOING ACROSS SEVERAL LANES JUST TO AVOID THIS VEHICLE TO PASS. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Rascon: THE GARCIA FAMILY WAS DRIVING TOGETHER IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DAY. DAD ALLEN, 7-YEAR-OLD ISAAC, AND ILLIANA, WHO THEY CALLED LILLY. HER MOTHER VERONICA WRITING ONLINE... MOST ROAD RAGE INCIDENTS ARE NOT DEADLY, LIKE THIS ONE SEVERAL DAYS AGO NEAR DALLAS. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Man: WHAT WERE YOU DOING WHEN YOU HIT THEM? &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Man: I DON&#65533;T CARE. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Rascon: ONE STUDY FINDS SOME 66% OF TRAFFIC DEATHS ARE LINKED TO AGGRESSIVE DRIVING. AND AAA SAYS FATALITIES AND INJURIES LINKED TO AGGRESSIVE DRIVING INCREASE EVERY YEAR. DANGEROUS DRIVING WITH DEADLY CONSEQUENCES AND A FAMILY FORCED TO SAY GOODBYE TO A BELOVED DAUGHTER. THE FBI AND LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT HAVE BEEN WORKING AROUND THE CLOCK ON THIS CASE. LATE TODAY, THEY ANNOUNCED THEY HAVE IN CUSTODY SOMEONE WHO APPEARED TO MATCH THE GUNMAN&#65533;S DESCRIPTION BUT ARE WAITING TO RELEASE MORE INFORMATION UNTIL THEY SERVE SEARCH WARRANTS. LESTER? &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Holt: ALL RIGHT, JACOB RASCON, THANK YOU. WE&#65533;RE BACK IN A MOMENT WITH THE NEW CHARACTER MOVING TO &quot;SESAME STREET&quot; AND WHY SHE&#65533;S SO GROUNDBREAKING. THERE IS NEW RESEARCH OUT THAT FINDS CHILDREN WHO FREQUENTLY TAKE ANTIBIOTICS GAIN WEIGHT FASTER THAN KIDS WHO NEVER TAKE THEM. IT&#65533;S THE LARGEST STUDY OF ITS KIND USING THE MEDICAL RECORDS OF OVER 160,000 CHILDREN, ADDING TO EVIDENCE LINKING ANTIBIOTICS AND WEIGHT GAIN. SCIENTISTS SAY THE REASON COULD BE BECAUSE THE MEDICINE GETS RID OF CERTAIN BACTERIA, CHANGING THE WAY A CHILD&#65533;S BODY BREAKS DOWN FOOD. RESEARCHERS SAY IT&#65533;S ONE MORE REASON TO TAKE ANTIBIOTICS ONLY WHEN ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY. A DRAMATIC INCREASE TO REPORT IN THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE USING MARIJUANA IN THIS COUNTRY. ACCORDING TO A NEW STUDY, POT USE AMONG AMERICAN ADULTS HAS MORE THAN DOUBLED IN THE PAST DECADE OR SO TO MORE THAN 9%. 23 STATES NOW ALLOW SOME FORM OF MEDICAL MARIJUANA. RECREATIONAL USE IS LEGAL IN FOUR STATES AND WASHINGTON, D.C. &quot;SESAME STREET&quot; HAS A NEW KID ON THE BLOCK. HER NAME IS JULIA, AND SHE IS THE FIRST &quot;SESAME&quot; CHARACTER WITH AUTISM. SHE IS PART OF A NEW ONLINE PROGRAM AIMED AT GIVING KIDS WITH AUTISM A CHARACTER THEY CAN RELATE TO AND HELPING OTHERS UNDERSTAND WHAT IT MEANS TO HAVE AUTISM. JULIA&#65533;S FIRST ADVENTURE IS A PLAY DATE WITH ELMO. IT&#65533;S A IN A FREE STORY BOOK AVAILABLE ONLINE RIGHT NOW. AND THERE IS WORD OF A HOLLYWOOD SEQUEL THIS EVENING. CHRIS ROCK WILL RETURN AS HOST OF THE 88th ACADEMY AWARDS NEXT YEAR, 11 YEARS AFTER HIS FIRST OSCARS HOSTING GIG IN 2005. THE 50-YEAR-OLD ROCK MADE THE ANNOUNCEMENT POSTING A PHOTO OF HIMSELF WITH AN OSCAR STATUETTE AND THE CAPTION, &quot;LOOK WHO&#65533;S BACK.&quot; WHEN WE COME BACK, PUTTING FAMILY FIRST. HOW THE LEADERSHIP BATTLE IN THE HOUSE IS EXPOSING A PERSONAL BATTLE MANY OF US ARE HAVING IN OUR HOMES. FINALLY TONIGHT, CAN YOU REALLY HAVE IT ALL AT WORK AND AT HOME? IT&#65533;S A QUESTION WORKING MOMS HAVE TO ANSWER ALL OF THE TIME. BUT SOMETHING CONGRESSMAN PAUL RYAN SAID, AS OUR HALLIE JACKSON TELLS US, IS OPENING UP THE DEBATE ABOUT WORK-LIFE BALANCE FOR DADS. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Jackson: IT&#65533;S NOT THE PRESSURE OF THIS POWERFUL POSITION GIVING PAUL RYAN PAUSE. CONGRESS&#65533;S YOUNG GUN IS THINKING ABOUT HIS THREE YOUNG KIDS. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Ryan: I CANNOT AND WILL NOT GIVE UP MY FAMILY TIME. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Jackson: UNLIKE HIS RUN FOR THE VICE PRESIDENCY, WHERE HIS FAMILY WOULD HAVE LIVED WITH HIM IN WASHINGTON, AS SPEAKER, RYAN WOULD STILL HAVE TO COMMUTE TO WISCONSIN ON WEEKENDS WHILE WRANGLING FUNDRAISING TRIPS THAT WOULD CUT IN TO QUALITY TIME AT HOME. RYAN, WHO CONSIDERS HIS FAMILY TIME HIS OXYGEN, IS NOW BREATHING NEW LIFE INTO A NATIONAL DEBATE OVER HOW TO BALANCE WORK AND HOME. ONLINE REACTION RANGING FROM APPLAUSE TO ENVY. ONE MAN TWEETING... RYAN, TAKING SOME HEAT FOR HIS POSITION AGAINST A FEDERAL PAID LEAVE BILL, EVEN AS MOST MEN SAY THEY SUPPORT PAID PATERNITY LEAVE. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Schulte: THESE ARE ISSUES FOR EVERYBODY. THIS IS WHAT EVERYBODY WANTS. THIS IS NOT JUST WOMEN OR MOMMY ISSUES. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Jackson: OVER THE LAST FIVE DECADES, FATHERS HAVE TRIPLED TIME WITH THEIR KIDS. BUT NEARLY HALF STILL FEEL THEY AREN&#65533;T AROUND THEIR CHILDREN ENOUGH. AND DADS WHO ARE SOMETIMES FACE FIRE. REMEMBER WHEN DANIEL MURPHY MISSED TWO METS GAMES FOR THE BIRTH OF HIS SON? HE DOESN&#65533;T REGRET HOW HE BALANCED WORK AND FAMILY. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Murphy: FATHERHOOD IS A MUCH GREATER RESPONSIBILITY THAN 0 FOR 4, 2 FOR 4, 1 FOR 3 WITH A WALK. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Jackson: THIS FORTUNE 500 C.E.O. AND FATHER OF THREE MADE HEADLINES AFTER RESIGNING WHEN HE WROTE... HIGH-PROFILE EXAMPLES, BUT STILL RARE ONES ON THE NATIONAL STAGE. THE CONVERSATION AT THE CAPITOL SPARKING ANOTHER IN LIVING ROOMS ACROSS THE COUNTRY. HALLIE JACKSON, NBC NEWS, WASHINGTON. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Holt: THAT WILL DO IT FOR US ON THIS WEDNESDAY NIGHT. I&#65533;M LESTER HOLT. FOR ALL OF US AT NBC NEWS, THANK YOU FOR WATCHING, AND GOOD NIGHT.","smpte-tt":"http://videocaptions.nbcnews.com/smpte-tt/nn_netcast_151021.tt","srt":"http://videocaptions.nbcnews.com/srt/nn_netcast_151021.srt","web-vtt":"http://videocaptions.nbcnews.com/web-vtt/nn_netcast_151021.vtt"}},"sections":[{"title":"News","slug":"news"}],"topics":[{"title":"News","slug":"news"}],"externalSource":"WorkBench","taxons":[{"slug":"news","type":"Section","title":"News","topics":[]}],"broadcastDate":"Wed, Oct 21","playlistSlug":"full-broadcast"},{"video":{"type":"","widget_type":"","videoType":"Broadcast","mpxId":"548268099895","guid":"nn_netcast_151020","pubDate":"2015-10-21 01:44:00 Z","expirationDate":"2113-04-09 01:44:00 Z","playbackIsDisabled":false,"availabilityState":"available","title":"Nightly News Full Broadcast (October 20th)","description":"In Tuesday night's broadcast: new breast cancer guidelines, Biden's latest comments raise eyebrows, and what \"Back to the Future\" got right about 2015.","thumbnail":"http://media2.s-nbcnews.com/i/MSNBC/Components/Video/__NEW/nn_netcast_151020.jpg","source":"Nightly News Netcast","sourceId":null,"canonicalUrl":"http://www.nbcnews.com/nightly-news-netcast/video/nightly-news-full-broadcast-october-20th-548268099895","shortUrl":"http://nbcnews.to/1knZNoX","associatedPlaylistUrl":"http://feed.theplatform.com/f/2E2eJC/nnd_18424748","fallbackPlaylistUrl":null,"topVideosPlaylistUrl":"http://feed.theplatform.com/f/2E2eJC/nnd_20381145","mezzVersion":"1","embedUrl":"http://player.theplatform.com/p/2E2eJC/nbcNewsOffsite?guid=nn_netcast_151020","videoAssets":[{"format":"QT","assetType":"Mezzanine Video","publicUrl":"http://link.theplatform.com/s/2E2eJC/KpHxFrIJ0rgf","width":"0","height":"0","bitRate":"6000000","privateUrl":null,"duration":"1223","durationISO":"PT20M23S"},{"format":"MPEG4","assetType":"Limelight MP4","publicUrl":"http://link.theplatform.com/s/2E2eJC/C3u4hdjjCK5R","width":"640","height":"360","bitRate":"800000","privateUrl":null,"duration":"1223","durationISO":"PT20M23S"},{"format":"MPEG4","assetType":"Limelight MP4","publicUrl":"http://link.theplatform.com/s/2E2eJC/ZRvlxiNbJzUa","width":"420","height":"240","bitRate":"500000","privateUrl":null,"duration":"1223","durationISO":"PT20M23S"},{"format":"ISM","assetType":"Smooth_1","publicUrl":"http://link.theplatform.com/s/2E2eJC/80wBBaeGCbne","width":"1464","height":"824","bitRate":"3763968","privateUrl":null,"duration":"1223.833","durationISO":"PT20M23.833S"}],"video_playlists":[{"playlist_id":"nnd_18424748","label":null}],"nativeVideo":false,"autoPlay":false,"defaultAssociation":"NBC News/Sections/Nightly Netcast","duration":1223,"hasCaption":true,"durationISO":"PT20M23S","captionLinks":{"requiresCaptioning":"True","clean":"&gt;&gt; Holt: TONIGHT, BREAST CANCER CONFUSION. A MAJOR SHIFT FROM THE AMERICAN CANCER SOCIETY OVER WHAT AGE WOMEN SHOULD START GETTING MAMMOGRAMS. TONIGHT, THE HEATED DEBATE AND THE QUESTION SO MANY ARE ASKING. BIDEN VERSUS CLINTON? THE VICE PRESIDENT SUDDENLY SOUNDING A LOT MORE LIKE A CANDIDATE SEEMINGLY TAKING SWIPES AT HILLARY CLINTON AND WHAT HE SAID TODAY ABOUT THE BIN LADEN RAID RAISING EYEBROWS. NEW CAR RANKINGS -- WHICH ARE THE MOST RELIABLE, AND WHICH COULD GIVE YOU THE MOST HEADACHES? WE&#65533;VE GOT THE LIST FILLED WITH SURPRISES. AND THE FUTURE IS NOW. OCTOBER 21, 2015. WE&#65533;RE HOURS FROM THE DATE MARTY McFLY STEPPED OUT OF THE DeLOREAN AND HOPPED ON A HOVERBOARD. WHAT DID THE MOVIE GET RIGHT AND WRONG? &quot;NIGHTLY NEWS&quot; BEGINS RIGHT NOW. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Announcer: FROM NBC NEWS WORLD HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK, THIS IS &quot;NBC NIGHTLY NEWS&quot; WITH LESTER HOLT. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Holt: GOOD EVENING. DOCTORS SAY ONE IN EIGHT WOMEN IN THE U.S. WILL DEVELOP BREAST CANCER, AND SO YOU&#65533;D BE HARD-PRESSED TO FIND A PERSON IN THIS COUNTRY WHO DOESN&#65533;T KNOW SOMEONE OR WHOSE OWN LIFE HASN&#65533;T BEEN TOUCHED BY IT. AND SO NEWS TODAY THAT THE RULES OF EARLY DETECTION HAVE CHANGED VIRTUALLY OVERNIGHT HAS CREATED AN AWFUL LOT OF WORRY AND CONFUSION. HERE&#65533;S WHAT HAPPENED. THE AMERICAN CANCER SOCIETY CAME OUT TODAY TO SAY WOMEN NEED FEWER MAMMOGRAMS STARTING LATER IN LIFE. THAT RUNS COUNTER TO WHAT SOME OTHER GROUPS RECOMMEND. WE KNOW IT RAISES A LOT QUESTIONS. I&#65533;LL PUT SOME OF THEM TO A DOCTOR HERE IN OUR STUDIO IN A MOMENT. BUT FIRST, ANNE THOMPSON WITH THE NEW GUIDELINES. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Woman: TO GOOD HEALTH! &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Thompson: IN THIS SEASON OF PINK... [ CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKS ] ...THE AMERICAN CANCER SOCIETY MOVES THE MAMMOGRAM STARTING LINE. INSTEAD OF AGE 40, TODAY IT RECOMMENDS WOMEN START AT 45 IF THEY ARE OF AVERAGE RISK, WITHOUT GENETIC MUTATIONS OR A FAMILY HISTORY OF BREAST CANCER. AT 55, WOMEN SHOULD TRANSITION TO SCREENING EVERY OTHER YEAR IF THEY HAVE A LIFE EXPECTANCY OF 10 YEARS OR LONGER. THE AMERICAN CANCER SOCIETY SAID THE CHANGES ARE DESIGNED TO ELIMINATE FALSE POSITIVES AND OVER-TREATMENT. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Dr. Wender: BY 45, THE BENEFITS CLEARLY OUTWEIGH THE DRAWBACKS, AND ALL WOMEN SHOULD PARTICIPATE IN SCREENING. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Thompson: IT IS ALSO NO LONGER RECOMMENDING CLINICAL BREAST EXAMS AT ANY AGE. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Dr. Wender: THE LIFE-SAVING POTENTIAL OF EARLY DETECTION REALLY IS FOUND IN REGULAR MAMMOGRAPHY. THAT&#65533;S THE TEST THAT CAN FIND A CANCER BEFORE ANYBODY CAN FEEL IT. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Thompson: YET WITHIN THE HEALTH COMMUNITY, THERE IS DISAGREEMENT ON WHEN TO START. A FEDERAL TASK FORCE SAYS IT SHOULD BE AGE 50. THE AMERICAN COLLEGE OF OBSTETRICIANS AND GYNECOLOGISTS IS STICKING WITH 40. ONE MORE OBSTACLE FOR MARY SOLOMON&#65533;S MOBILE MAMMOGRAM UNIT TO NAVIGATE AS IT TREATS UNINSURED WOMEN IN NEW YORK CITY. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Solomon: SO YOU WORKED WITH US LAST YEAR. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Thompson: IS THIS JUST GOING TO ADD TO THE CONFUSION? &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Solomon: OH, WITHOUT A DOUBT. OUR WOMEN ARE GENERALLY LOW-INCOME, LOW-INFORMATION CONSUMERS. SO YES, THIS WILL BE A VERY DIFFICULT THING FOR THEM TO PUT THEIR HEAD AROUND. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Thompson: EARLY DETECTION HELPED SAVE MARY&#65533;S MOTHER, WHO DROVE HER OWN MAMMOGRAPHY VAN. AND AMY KEFFER. AT AGE 40, HER VERY FIRST MAMMOGRAM REVEALED THIS MOM HAD AN AGGRESSIVE FORM OF BREAST CANCER. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Keffer: IT&#65533;S FRUSTRATING FOR WOMEN WHO WANT TO DO THE RIGHT THING, AND THEY ARE CONSTANTLY BEING TOLD SOMETHING DIFFERENT. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Thompson: AS WOMEN AND THEIR DOCTORS STRUGGLE WITH WHEN TO GET SCREENED, THERE MAY BE COMFORT IN THIS -- FEDERAL LAW REQUIRES MOST INSURERS TO COVER MAMMOGRAMS FROM AGE 40 ON TO PROTECT THEM FROM THE SECOND-DEADLIEST FORM OF CANCER. ANNE THOMPSON, NBC NEWS, NEW YORK. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Holt: AND AS I SAID AT THE TOP, LOTS OF QUESTIONS ABOUT THIS. DR. ROSHINI RAJ SPECIALIZES IN WOMEN&#65533;S HEALTH AND CANCER SCREENING AT NYU&#65533;S LANGONE MEDICAL CENTER. DOCTOR, THANKS FOR BEING HERE. IF A WOMAN WANTS TO GO AHEAD AND GET THE MAMMOGRAM AT 40, IGNORE THESE RECOMMENDATIONS AND GO WITH THE OTHERS, WHAT IS THE HARM? &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Dr. Raj: THERE&#65533;S REALLY NOT A BIG DOWNSIDE WHEN YOU&#65533;RE TALKING ABOUT GOING AND GETTING IT AT 40. IN FACT, SOME GROUPS ARE RECOMMENDING IT AT 40. HOWEVER, THE NEW GUIDELINES SAY 45 MAY BE MORE REASONABLE BECAUSE YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE SOME FALSE-POSITIVES. THAT MEANS PEOPLE UNDER 45 GOING TO GET THE MAMMOGRAM, SOMETHING IS FOUND, THEY GO THROUGH A LOT OF TESTS, A LOT OF ANXIETY, AND IN THE END, IT&#65533;S NOT CANCER. SO THAT&#65533;S WHY THEY SAID START AT AGE 45. BUT THEY DID SAY IF YOU WANT GET IT AT 40, YOU SHOULD HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO GET IT AT 40. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Holt: WHAT, IN GENERAL, SHOULD WOMEN DO WITH THIS INFORMATION TODAY? &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Dr. Raj: WELL, THE FACT THAT WE HAVE THREE DIFFERENT GROUPS RECOMMENDING THREE DIFFERENT TIMES REALLY SUGGESTS THAT WE DON&#65533;T KNOW THE EXACT TIME ANSWER FOR EVERY WOMAN. IT&#65533;S AN INDIVIDUAL CHOICE. YOU REALLY NEED TO DISCUSS IT WITH YOUR DOCTOR. AND LET&#65533;S BE CLEAR -- THIS IS FOR AVERAGE RISK WOMEN. IF YOU HAVE A FAMILY HISTORY, OF COURSE, IF YOU HAVE A PERSONAL HISTORY OF ANOTHER TYPE OF CANCER, YOU REALLY NEED TO TALK TO YOUR DOCTOR ABOUT WHEN YOU SHOULD BE SCREENED. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Holt: ALL RIGHT, DR. RAJ. THANKS. GOOD TO HAVE YOU HERE. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Dr. Raj: THANK YOU. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Holt: TO PRESIDENTIAL POLITICS NOW AND THE VICE PRESIDENT DOING NOTHING TO QUIET THE SPECULATION THAT CONTINUES TO SWIRL AROUND HIM. IF ANYTHING, HE IS BEGINNING TO SOUND MORE LIKE A CANDIDATE, TAKING NOT-SO-VEILED SWIPES AT HILLARY CLINTON TODAY. MEANTIME, CLINTON IS GAINING BACK GROUND SHE LOST, INCREASING HER LEAD OVER BERNIE SANDERS TO A 20-POINT SPREAD IN OUR NEW POLL WHILE BIDEN ACTUALLY LOST SOME SUPPORT, DOWN TO 15%. NBC&#65533;s KRISTEN WELKER ON THE NEW BIDEN VERSUS CLINTON INTRIGUE. [ APPLAUSE ] &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Welker: AT AN EVENT HONORING FORMER VICE PRESIDENT WALTER MONDALE, THE CURRENT VICE PRESIDENT SOUNDED A LOT LIKE A PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE, TODAY CASTING HIMSELF AS THE STANDARD BEARER OF THE OBAMA LEGACY. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Biden: PRESIDENT OBAMA AND I IDEOLOGICALLY HAVE HAD NO DISAGREEMENT. NONE. I MEAN ZERO. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Welker: TO ILLUSTRATE THE POINT, BIDEN SAID HE AND THE PRESIDENT WERE IN LOCK-STEP WHEN IT CAME TO AUTHORIZING THE RAID AGAINST OSAMA BIN LADEN. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Biden: I TOLD HIM MY OPINION, THAT I THOUGHT HE SHOULD GO BUT FOLLOW HIS OWN INSTINCTS. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Welker: BUT THAT ACCOUNT DIFFERS FROM BIDEN&#65533;S DESCRIPTION TO NBC NEWS DURING AN INTERVIEW TAPED FOR THE 2012 SPECIAL, &quot;THE SITUATION ROOM,&quot; WHEN BIDEN SAID HE&#65533;D URGED THE PRESIDENT TO GET MORE INFORMATION. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Biden: &quot;I THINK THERE&#65533;S TIME TO DO IT BEFORE YOU MOVE.&quot; &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Welker: BIDEN ALSO TOOK A VEILED SWIPE AT DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL FRONT-RUNNER HILLARY CLINTON FOR WHAT SHE SAID AT LAST WEEK&#65533;S DEBATE WHEN ASKED WHICH ENEMIES SHE&#65533;S MOST PROUD OF. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Clinton: PROBABLY THE REPUBLICANS. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Biden: I STILL HAVE A LOT OF REPUBLICAN FRIENDS. I DON&#65533;T THINK MY CHIEF ENEMY IS THE REPUBLICAN PARTY. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Welker: BUT BIDEN, WHOSE INITIAL SUPPORT CAME FROM DEMOCRATS CONCERNED ABOUT CLINTON&#65533;S WEAKNESSES, WOULD FACE AN INCREASINGLY STEEP UPHILL BATTLE. CLINTON HAS BEEN GAINING STRENGTH, AND NOW A PLURALITY OF DEMOCRATS -- 38% to 30% -- SAY THEY DON&#65533;T WANT BIDEN TO GET IN. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Cummings: THEY FEEL LIKE THEY ARE FROZEN IN PLACE UNTIL THE VICE PRESIDENT MAKES HIS DECISION. AND THAT&#65533;S NOT BEEN HELPFUL FOR THE PARTY. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Welker: LONGTIME CLINTON SUPPORTER JAMES CARVILLE SAID HE WILL SUPPORT WHOMEVER THE DEMOCRATS NOMINATE BUT WAS BLUNT ABOUT BIDEN. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Carville: JUST MAKE UP YOUR MIND. IF YOU WANT TO DO IT, FOR GOD SAKES, YOU DESERVE TO TAKE A SHOT HERE. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Welker: AND LESTER, AS SOLID AS HILLARY CLINTON&#65533;S LEAD IS, OUR NEW POLL ALSO HIGHLIGHTS A SIGNIFICANT WEAKNESS. 44% OF AMERICANS ARE NOT SATISFIED WITH HER RESPONSE TO THE BENGHAZI ATTACKS WHILE ONLY 27% SAY THEY ARE. THAT MAKES THURSDAY CRITICAL FOR HER AS SHE TESTIFIES BEFORE THE CONGRESSIONAL COMMITTEE INVESTIGATING THAT MATTER. LESTER? &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Holt: ALL RIGHT, KRISTIN, THANKS. AND ON THE REPUBLICAN SIDE OF RACE, DONALD TRUMP REMAINS THE FRONT-RUNNER IN OUR LATEST POLLING. BUT DUE TO THE MARGIN OF ERROR, BEN CARSON IS ACTUALLY IN A STATISTICAL DEAD HEAT FOR THE LEAD. CARSON&#65533;S UNORTHODOX APPROACH CONTINUES TO CONNECT WITH VOTERS EVEN AS, OUR HALLIE JACKSON TELLS US, HE TAKES TIME FROM HIS CAMPAIGN TO PROMOTE A NEW BOOK. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Jackson: BEN CARSON TODAY CRANKING OUT SNAPSHOTS ON AN AUTOGRAPH ASSEMBLY LINE. NOT A POLITICAL RALLY, BUT A BOOK TOUR, THE DOCTOR AND AUTHOR, LONG BEFORE A POLITICIAN, RAMPING DOWN CAMPAIGN EVENTS, YET STILL SURGING. NEARLY THREE QUARTERS OF REPUBLICANS NOW SAY THEY COULD SEE THEMSELVES VOTING FOR THE FIRST-TIME CANDIDATE. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Heye: BEN CARSON&#65533;S CANDIDACY HAS BEEN A REAL MYSTERY FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE. HE IS NOT ONLY A NONTRADITIONAL CANDIDATE, HE GIVES REALLY NONTRADITIONAL ANSWERS IN NONTRADITIONAL WAYS. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Jackson: CARSON&#65533;S CASH FLOW, RAISING A LOT BUT SPENDING IT FAST, HAS BEEN FUELED PARTLY BY HIS CONTROVERSIAL COMMENTS ON GUN CONTROL AND THE HOLOCAUST AND MUSLIM AMERICANS. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Carson: I WOULD NOT ADVOCATE THAT WE PUT A MUSLIM IN CHARGE OF THIS NATION. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Jackson: REMARKS MISCHARACTERIZED, HE SAYS, BY THE MEDIA. BUT CARSON CAN USE A DIFFERENT PLATFORM TO GET HIS MESSAGE OUT -- FACEBOOK, WHERE HE HAS MORE LIKES THAN ANY OTHER GOP CANDIDATE. AND WHILE THAT MAY NOT SEEM LIKE A BIG DEAL, THINK OF IT THIS WAY. A SINGLE POST TO HIS PAGE COULD REACH 4.3 MILLION PEOPLE, NEARLY AS MANY AS THE POPULATIONS OF IOWA AND NEW HAMPSHIRE COMBINED. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Woman: BECAUSE HE&#65533;S NOT THE TYPICAL POLITICIAN. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Carson: I&#65533;M NEVER GOING TO BE A POLITICIAN, SO I&#65533;M NOT GOING TO USE THEIR PLAYBOOK. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Jackson: AND WHILE HE ISN&#65533;T A TYPICAL POLITICIAN, HE IS TRYING TO ORGANIZE LIKE ONE. IN KEY STATES LIKE IOWA, WHERE THE SEVENTH DAY ADVENTIST LOOKS STRONG AMONG EVANGELICALS, AND THAT COULD BE A PROBLEM FOR OTHER CANDIDATES ANGLING FOR FAITH-BASED VOTERS, LIKE TED CRUZ. HE IS NOW TAKING FIRE FROM FORMER PRESIDENT GEORGE W. BUSH, WHO REPORTEDLY TOLD A GROUP OF DONORS HE JUST DOESN&#65533;T LIKE THE SENATOR. THAT COULD ACTUALLY WORK FOR CRUZ, WHO&#65533;S CAMPAIGNING AGAINST ESTABLISHMENT REPUBLICANS LIKE BUSH, IN WHAT&#65533;S STILL A RACE THE OUTSIDERS OWN. DEFYING PUNDIT&#65533;S PREDICTIONS. HALLIE JACKSON, NBC NEWS, WASHINGTON. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Holt: THE U.S. PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN, OF COURSE, HAS BEEN UNDERWAY FOR MONTHS AND STILL HAS MORE THAN A YEAR TO GO. BUT CANADA HAS JUST CHOSEN A NEW LEADER IN A CAMPAIGN THAT LASTED A MERE 11 WEEKS, AND THAT&#65533;S LONG FOR THEM. THE WINNER, IN AN UPSET, IS 43-YEAR-OLD JUSTIN TRUDEAU. A RELATIVE NEWCOMER TO POLITICS, BUT ONE WITH A LEGENDARY NAME. AND HE PROMISES SOME BIG CHANGES. NBC&#65533;s GABE GUITERREZ HAS HIS STORY. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Trudeau: I HAVE A SIMPLE MESSAGE FOR YOU. ON BEHALF OF 35 MILLION CANADIANS, WE&#65533;RE BACK. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Gutierrez: JUSTIN TRUDEAU IS CANADA&#65533;S FUTURE AND ITS PAST. THE SON OF PIERRE AND MARGARET TRUDEAU, THE CHARISMATIC FORMER PRIME MINISTER AND HIS FORMER FLOWER CHILD BRIDE, CANADA&#65533;S GLAMOROUS POWER COUPLE IN THE &#65533;70s AND &#65533;80s. JUSTIN GREW UP IN THAT SPOTLIGHT AND LAST NIGHT CLAIMED IT FOR HIMSELF, HIS LIBERAL PARTY WINNING A STUNNING UPSET. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Trudeau: IT&#65533;S TIME FOR A CHANGE IN THIS COUNTRY, MY FRIENDS. A REAL CHANGE. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Gutierrez: TRUDEAU IS 43, MARRIED TO A FORMER TELEVISION HOST AND MODEL. HE GOT INTO POLITICS JUST EIGHT YEARS AGO AFTER TRYING HIS HAND AS A SNOWBOARD INSTRUCTOR, A NIGHTCLUB BOUNCER, AND A HIGH SCHOOL TEACHER. HIS CRITICS CALLED HIS RESUME &quot;THIN.&quot; &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Woman: BEING PRIME MINISTER IS NOT AN ENTRY LEVEL JOB. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Gutierrez: BUT TRUDEAU INSISTED HE WAS READY, AND THE VOTERS AGREED, SENDING CONSERVATIVE INCUMBENT STEPHEN HARPER PACKING. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Harper: THE PEOPLE ARE NEVER WRONG. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Gutierrez: TRUDEAU PROMISES TO CUT TAXES, SPEND BILLIONS TO BOOST THE ECONOMY, ACT AGAINST CLIMATE CHANGE, LEGALIZE MARIJUANA, AND LEAD THE U.S.-LED AIR CAMPAIGN AGAINST ISIS IN IRAQ AND SYRIA. WHY SHOULD AMERICANS CARE ABOUT CANADIAN POLITICS? &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Todd: WE NOW HAVE A CANADIAN GOVERNMENT THAT IS POLITICALLY MORE IN LINE WITH THE AMERICAN GOVERNMENT. DOES THAT MEAN BETTER RELATIONS? RELATIONS HAVE ALWAYS BEEN GOOD, BUT THEY&#65533;VE ACTUALLY NOT BEEN SO GREAT OF LATE. WILL THEY NOW GET BETTER? THAT IS WHY AMERICANS SHOULD CARE. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Gutierrez: A YOUNG NEW LEADER, A FAMILIAR OLD NAME, AND PERHAPS A LITTLE NORTHERN STAR POWER. GABE GUITERREZ, NBC NEWS, MONTREAL. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Holt: NOW TO A GROWING CONTROVERSY IN SOUTH FLORIDA SURROUNDING THE SHOOTING DEATH OF A CHURCH MUSICIAN ALONGSIDE A MAJOR HIGHWAY. HE HAD PULLED OVER WITH CAR TROUBLE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT. SOMEHOW, THAT LED TO A FATAL ENCOUNTER WITH A PLAINCLOTHES POLICE OFFICER. NOW HIS FAMILY IS DEMANDING ANSWERS. WE GET MORE FROM NBC&#65533;s MARK POTTER. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Potter: 31-YEAR-OLD CORY JONES WAS A WELL-KNOWN DRUMMER IN PALM BEACH COUNTY WHO PLAYED IN CHURCHES AND WAS IN A LOCAL BAND PREPARING FOR A NATIONAL TOUR. POLICE SAY HE WAS KILLED AT 3:15 SUNDAY MORNING ALONG AN EXIT RAMP FOR INTERSTATE 95 WHERE FRIENDS SAY HE WAS WAITING FOR A TOW TRUCK BECAUSE OF CAR TROUBLE. THE PALM BEACH GARDENS POLICE DEPARTMENT SAYS ONE OF ITS OFFICERS, NOUMAN RAJA, DROVE UP IN AN UNMARKED CAR AND IN PLAIN CLOTHES. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Stepp: AS THE OFFICER EXITED HIS VEHICLE, HE WAS SUDDENLY CONFRONTED BY AN ARMED SUBJECT. AS A RESULT OF THE CONFRONTATION, THE OFFICER DISCHARGED HIS FIREARM, RESULTING IN THE DEATH OF MR. CORY JONES. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Potter: POLICE SAY THEY FOUND A HANDGUN JONES PURCHASED THREE DAYS BEFORE THE INCIDENT. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Sylvester Jr.: I CAN&#65533;T EXPLAIN IT. IT JUST HURTS, MAN. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Simeonov: THEY LOST AN AMAZING PERSON, A REALLY SPECIAL HUMAN BEING. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Potter: HIS FAMILY AND FRIENDS ARE SHOCKED BY THE POLICE ACCOUNT OF THE SHOOTING, SAYING JONES WAS NONVIOLENT. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Sylvester Sr.: I PLEAD TO THAT INDIVIDUAL THAT HE GONNA BE ACCOUNTABLE FOR WHAT HE HAS DONE. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Potter: JONES WORKED AS AN INSPECTOR FOR THE DEL RAY BEACH HOUSING AUTHORITY. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Ellington: HE WAS A GOOD PERSON, A GOOD SOUL. A GOOD HUMAN BEING. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Potter: JONES&#65533; FAMILY HAS HIRED ATTORNEY BENJAMIN CRUMP, KNOWN FOR HIS WORK IN PREVIOUS HIGH-PROFILE POLICE SHOOTING CASES. OFFICER RAJA JOINED THE PALM BEACH GARDENS POLICE DEPARTMENT IN APRIL AFTER SERVING SEVEN YEARS IN ATLANTIS, FLORIDA, WHERE THE CHIEF SAYS HE WAS IN GOOD STANDING. RAJA IS NOW ON PAID LEAVE AS THE PALM BEACH SHERIFF&#65533;S OFFICE INVESTIGATES THE SHOOTING. MARK POTTER, NBC NEWS, MIAMI. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Holt: DANGEROUS WEATHER TORE THROUGH THE SOUTHWEST TODAY CAUSING FLOODING IN CENTRAL ARIZONA THAT TRAPPED A WOMAN IN HER MINIVAN NORTH OF PHOENIX. A RESCUE CREW WADED INTO THE FAST-MOVING WATER AND WAS ABLE TO PULL HER TO SAFETY. A NUMBER OF FUNNEL CLOUDS HAVE BEEN REPORTED IN AND AROUND THE PHOENIX AREA. AND TO THE NORTH, FLAGSTAFF GOT PELTED WITH HAIL. ALMOST LOOKS LIKE SNOW BLANKETING THE AREA IN THAT PICTURE. STILL AHEAD TONIGHT, JUST HOW WELL DO AMERICAN CARS STACK UP AGAINST THEIR FOREIGN COUNTERPARTS WHEN IT COMES TO RELIABILITY? AND WHERE DOES YOUR CAR SIT. SOME REAL SURPRISES IN THE NEW ANNUAL REPORT. WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW. ALSO, THE HAIR-RISING FLIGHT THROUGH A SKY STREAKED WITH LIGHTNING, ALL CAUGHT ON CAMERA. SO, HOW IS YOUR CAR RUNNING? THERE WAS A TIME WE MEASURED CAR RELIABILITY MOSTLY BY WHAT WAS HAPPENING UNDER THE HOOD. BUT PACKING CARS WITH NEW TECHNOLOGY HAS NOT ONLY OFFERED NEW FEATURES, BUT ALSO NEW HEADACHES AS REFLECTED IN TODAY&#65533;S RELEASE OF THE MOST HIGHLY WATCHED AND RESPECTED ANNUAL AUTO SURVEY. TOM COSTELLO NOW WITH HOW TODAY&#65533;S MODELS STACK UP, INCLUDING SOME SURPRISES. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Costello: THE LIST IS COMPILED FROM 740,000 CONSUMER REPORTS SUBSCRIBERS, DETAILING HOW RELIABLE THEIR EXISTING CARS ARE. BUT NEW TECHNOLOGY ON THE DASHBOARD AND IN THE TRANSMISSIONS IS PROVING TO BE A HANG-UP FOR SEVERAL BIG-NAMED AUTOMAKERS. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Fisher&quot; TECHNOLOGY IS MOVING VERY, VERY QUICKLY, AND IT&#65533;S MOVING MUCH FASTER THAN THE CAR MANUFACTURERS CAN KEEP UP. WHEN THEY&#65533;RE BUILDING THESE CARS, SOMETIMES THE LIFE CYCLE OF THE CAR IS SEVEN YEARS. WELL, IF YOU HAVE A SMARTPHONE THAT IS SEVEN YEARS OLD, THE THING IS BASICALLY GARBAGE. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Costello: STARTING WITH THE MOST RELIABLE CARS, TOYOTA/LEXUS ARE ON TOP, FOLLOWED BY AUDI, MAZDA, SUBARU, KOREA&#65533;S KIA, AND THE ONLY AMERICAN IN THE TOP 10, BUICK. KIA EVEN SURPASSED PERENNIAL POWERHOUSES HONDA AND ACURA. AMONG THE LEAST-RELIABLE VEHICLES ON THE CONSUMER REPORTS LIST, LINCOLN, FORD, ACURA, GMC, AND CHEVROLET. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Rechtin: AT FIAT-CHRYSLER AUTOMOBILES, THE STRUGGLES CONTINUE. IT PRODUCED FIVE OF THE WORST SEVEN BRANDS, WITH RAM, JEEP, AND FIAT THE BOTTOM THREE AMONG OUR SUBSCRIBERS. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Costello: TRANSMISSION ISSUES THE BIGGEST COMPLAINT. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; LeBeau: BUT HERE&#65533;S THE INTERESTING POINT. JEEP RATED AS THE SECOND-WORST BRAND WHEN IT COMES TO RELIABILITY. AND YET, BECAUSE OF THE STYLING, BECAUSE OF THE MARKETING, AND BECAUSE OF THE LOOK OF THE JEEP MODELS THAT ARE BEING SOLD RIGHT NOW, SALES HAVE NEVER BEEN STRONGER. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Costello: THE STUNNER -- TESLA. THE CAR CONSUMER REPORTS CALLED &quot;THE BEST CAR IT EVER TESTED&quot; GETS A WORSE-THAN-AVERAGE RELIABILITY SCORE. TESLA SAYS ITS TECHNOLOGY ALLOWS IT TO FIX SOFTWARE BUGS IN ITS CARS REMOTELY. FIAT, FORD, GM, AND ACURA ALL TELL NBC NEWS THEY ARE LISTENING TO THE CUSTOMERS AND WORKING TO IMPROVE. TOM COSTELLO, NBC NEWS, WASHINGTON. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Holt: WE&#65533;VE GOT MUCH MORE INFORMATION ABOUT THE CONSUMER REPORT&#65533;S AUTO RANKINGS ON OUR WEBSITE, NBCNEWS.COM. WE&#65533;RE BACK IN A MOMENT WITH A RECORD THE NEW &quot;STAR WARS&quot; MOVIE HAS ALREADY TAKEN A LIGHTSABER TO MONTHS BEFORE IT HITS THEATERS. ACCORDING TO A FAMILY STATEMENT, AN AILING LAMAR ODOM HAS TAKEN A FEW STEPS IN LOS ANGELES WHERE HE HAS REPORTEDLY BEEN TRANSFERRED TO A NEW HOSPITAL. TMZ SPORTS SPOTTED HIS MEDICAL CHOPPER IN LAS VEGAS BEFORE IT DEPARTED LAST NIGHT. HIS ESTRANGED WIFE KHLOE KARDASHIAN MADE HER FIRST OFFICIAL STATEMENT SINCE ODOM WAS FOUND UNCONSCIOUS LAST WEEK. SHE GAVE THANKS FOR THE &quot;ENDLESS PRAYERS DURING THIS DIFFICULT TIME.&quot; TAKE A LOOK AT THIS AMAZING IMAGE CAUGHT ON CAMERA DURING A FIERCE STORM OVER SYDNEY, AUSTRALIA. A PHOTOGRAPHER SNAPPING PHOTOS AT THE RIGHT MOMENT CAPTURED THIS HUGE BOLT OF LIGHTNING FLASHING BEYOND A QANTAS JET NEAR THE AIRPORT. IT WAS ALSO CAUGHT ON VIDEO. LOOKS LIKE THE PLANE TAKES A DIRECT HIT, BUT IN REALITY, IT WAS A SAFE DISTANCE AWAY. NOT EVEN THE FORCE COULD KEEP MOVIE SITES FROM CRASHING OVER DEMAND FOR TICKETS TO &quot;STAR WARS: THE FORCE AWAKENS.&quot; THEY WENT ON SALE YESTERDAY WITH THE DEBUT OF THE NEW TRAILER FOR THE FILM SMASHING THE RECORD FOR FIRST-DAY SALES ACCORDING TO FANDANGO. THE NEXT CHAPTER IN THE STAR WARS SAGA DOESN&#65533;T OPEN UNTIL DECEMBER 18th. BUT SOME SHOWS ARE ALREADY SOLD OUT. AND WE&#65533;LL GO FROM ONE BELOVED FILM FRANCHISE TO ANOTHER WHEN WE COME BACK. TURN ON YOUR FLUX CAPACITOR. WE&#65533;RE HEADING FOR A LANDMARK DATE IN MOVIE HISTORY. FINALLY TONIGHT, TAKE A SECOND AND IMAGINE WHAT THE WORLD WILL BE LIKE THREE DECADES FROM NOW. WILL THERE BE FLYING CARS? WILL WE LOOK BACK AND LAUGH ABOUT HOW PRIMITIVE TODAY&#65533;S CUTTING-EDGE TECHNOLOGY SEEMS? THAT WAS THE CHALLENGE FACING THE MOVIEMAKERS BEHIND &quot;BACK TO THE FUTURE PART II&quot; WHEN 1980s MARTY McFLY FIRED UP THE FLUX CAPACITOR AND TIME TRAVELED TO OCTOBER 21, 2015, WHICH HAPPENS TO BE TOMORROW&#65533;S DATE. SO WE THOUGHT NBC&#65533;s KEVIN TIBBLES SHOULD TAKE A LOOK AT HOW THE MOVIE&#65533;S VERSION OF WHAT 2015 WOULD BE LIKE STACKS UP TO REALITY. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Tibbles: READY FOR A LITTLE TIME TRAVEL? &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; McFly: WHEN ARE WE? &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Brown: WEDNESDAY, OCTOBER 21st, 2015. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Tibbles: LET&#65533;S GO BACK EXACTLY 30 YEARS WHEN, IN 1985, MICHAEL J. FOX AND CHRISTOPHER LLOYD BLASTED ONTO THE SCREEN IN &quot;BACK TO THE FUTURE.&quot; AND TO CELEBRATE, WE&#65533;VE MET KEN SMITH, WHO, FRANKLY, IS THE SPITTING IMAGE OF MARTY McFLY. HE SPENT THREE YEARS REBUILDING A SOUPED-UP DeLOREAN TO BE HIS TIME MACHINE. WHY DID THAT MOVIE HAVE STAYING POWER? &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Smith: HMM. SENSE OF FAMILY. SENSE OF POSSIBILITY. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Tibbles: SO HOW MANY OF THOSE FUTURE VISIONS BACK IN 1985 CAME TRUE? WELL, THERE WAS THE HOVER BOARD. PRETTY SOON, WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO BUY ONE JUST LIKE IT. HOW ABOUT VIDEO PHONE CALLS? &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Needles: [ Chuckling ] HEY! &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Tibbles: EVERYONE&#65533;S DOING THAT THESE DAYS. AND THOSE DOG-WALKING DRONES? DRONES ARE EVERYWHERE. BACK IN THE PRESENT, THE TOWN OF RESTON, VIRGINIA, HAS RENAMED ITSELF HILL VALLEY FOR THE ANNIVERSARY. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Hudgins: IT IS A WONDERFUL COMMUNITY, AND IT IS NICE TO CONNECT IT TO HILL VALLEY. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Tibbles: THE ENTIRE &quot;BACK TO THE FUTURE&quot; TRILOGY WILL BE SCREENED HERE WITH PROCEEDS GOING TO THE MICHAEL J. FOX FOUNDATION FOR PARKINSON&#65533;S RESEARCH. THERE IS A TIME-TRAVEL DREAMER IN ALL OF US. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; McFly: [ SCREAMS ] &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Woman: I THINK I&#65533;D LIKE TO DO THE ROARING &#65533;20s &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Man: I&#65533;D LOVE TO GO TO THE FUTURE. I&#65533;D LOVE TO TO SEE IF WE MAKE IT TO MARS. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Tibbles: AS FOR KEN SMITH, THERE IS NO TIME LIKE THE PRESENT TO CELEBRATE HIS FAVORITE FILM WITH THE FUTURE GENERATION OF FANS. KEVIN TIBBLES, NBC NEWS, RESTON -- MAKE THAT HILL VALLEY, VIRGINIA. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Holt: AND THAT WILL DO IT FOR US ON THIS TUESDAY NIGHT. I&#65533;M LESTER HOLT. FOR ALL OF US AT NBC NEWS, THANK YOU FOR WATCHING, AND GOOD NIGHT.","smpte-tt":"http://videocaptions.nbcnews.com/smpte-tt/nn_netcast_151020.tt","srt":"http://videocaptions.nbcnews.com/srt/nn_netcast_151020.srt","web-vtt":"http://videocaptions.nbcnews.com/web-vtt/nn_netcast_151020.vtt"}},"sections":[{"title":"News","slug":"news"}],"topics":[{"title":"News","slug":"news"}],"externalSource":"WorkBench","taxons":[{"slug":"news","type":"Section","title":"News","topics":[]}],"broadcastDate":"Tue,

A FATHER WHOSE SON DIAGNOSED  WITH CANCER WHILE PLAYING  COLLEGE FOOTBALL WRITES, I FEEL  SICK TO MY STOMACH THAT THE  ARTIFICIAL TURF CAN HAVE SO MANY CHEMICALS. WE ALSO HEARD FROM A COACH AT A  CAMP FOR GOAL KEEPERS WHO TOLD  US HE HAS NOT HAD ONE CASE. THERE&#39;S NO RESEARCH DIRECTLY  LINKING CRUMB RUBBER EXPOSURE TO CANCER. AND SOME DOCTORS SAY PROVING A  LINK WOULD BE VERY DIFFICULT.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; THE REASON IS THAT THE  BIOLOGY OF CANCER VARIES A LOT  BETWEEN DIMPBLT CANCERS. OUR OWN GENETICS VARY AND BOTH  HAVE A BIG IMPACT.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Reporter: THE INDUSTRY ALONG  WITH RESEARCH, STATES AND  LOCALITIES DEFEND THE TURF. AVAILABLE STUDIES GATHERED AND  SPOKE WITH PEDIATRICIANS,  SCIENTISTS AND ADVOCACY GROUPS  WHO SAY MORE RESEARCH NEEDS TO  BE DONE. THE EPA DOES TOO, BUT THE AGENCY DID NOT RESPOND TO OUR REQUEST  FOR AN INTERVIEW. IN A PREVIOUS STATEMENT THE  SPOKESPERSON SAID THE USE OF  CRUMB RUBBER REMAINS A STATE AND LOCAL DECISION. IN GLEN ROCK, NEW JERSEY, THEY  ARE DEBATING THE PROS AND CONS  OF A NEW CRUMB RUBBER FIELD. MICHAEL STEWART IS A FATHER OF  TWO AND PUSHING FOR THE TURF.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; YOU&#39;RE LOOKING AT CURRENTLY  THE RISK VERSUS THE REWARDS. RECREATIONALLY THE REWARDS ARE  GREAT. THERE&#39;S REALLY NO SCIENTIFIC  BASIS FOR LINKING A CAUSE TO  CANCER WITH THESE FIELDS YET.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Reporter: WHILE ANOTHER  FATHER OF TWO WANTS NO PART OF  IT.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; THE JARGON OF, WELL, IT DOES  RELEASE SOME CHEMICALS BUT NOT  ENOUGH FOR IT TO BE DANGEROUS,  THAT&#39;S NOT A VERY STRONG ANSWER  TO ME.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Reporter: THE VOTE IS ON  ELECTION DAY. A DIFFICULT CHOICE TO MAKE WITH  SOME WORRIED THEY DON&#39;T HAVE THE INFORMATION THEY NEED. TODAY ONE MEMBER OF CONGRESS  SENT A LETTER TO THE CDC ASKING  THE AGENCY TO CONDUCT AN  OFFICIAL STUDY TO EXAMINE WHAT  EFFECTS EXPOSURE TO CHEMICALS IN CRUMB RUBBER MAY HAVE ON @LEASE.

IT&#39;S SOMETHING A LOT OF PARENTS  AND ATHLETES ARE GOING TO WANT  TO SEE. IT&#39;S ABOUT ARTIFICIAL TURF ON  THE FOOTBALL FIELDS AND SOCCER  FIELDS THAT SO MANY OF OUR  CHILDREN PLAY ON ACROSS THE  COUNTRY. THE MATERIAL USED AS A GRANULAR  SYNTHETIC DIRT BETWEEN THE  PIECES OF ARTIFICIAL GRASS BE  HARMFUL? IT STARTS WITH A SOCCER COACH  WHO NOTICED SOMETHING ABOUT TWO  OF HER PLAYERS WHO DEVELOPED  CANCER. AND SHE LEARNED OF OTHER YOUNG  ATHLETES WITH SIMILAR STORIES. NBC&#39;S STEPHANIE GOSK HAS BEEN  INVESTIGATING THE STORY FOR  MONTHS AND TONIGHT HAS OUR  EXCLUSIVE REPORT.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Reporter: FOR NEARLY 30 YEARS SOCCER HAS BEEN AMY GRIFFIN&#39;S  PROFESSION AND PASSION.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; I LOVE THE HIGHS AND LOWS OF  SPORTS. THERE&#39;S NOT MANY JOBS ARE YOU  FEEL THE ECSTASY OF VICTORY AND  THE AGONY OF DEFEAT.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Reporter: BUT THERE WAS ONE  LOW THE UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON COACH DIDN&#39;T SEE COMING. TWO OF HER GOALKEEPERS DIAGNOSED WITH NONHODGKINS LYMPHOMA. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; SHE SAYS THAT&#39;S THE FOURTH  GOALKEEPER I&#39;VE HOOKED UP THIS  WEEK.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Reporter: SHE REMEMBERS A  CONVERSATION WITH HER PLAYER  THAT NOW HAUNTS HER.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; I HAVE A FEELING IT HAS  SOMETHING TO DO WITH THOSE BLACK DOTS.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; THIS IS THE STUFF EVERYBODY&#39;S TALKING ABOUT.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Reporter: SOCKER AND FOOTBALL PLAYERS ALIKE ARE VERY FAMILIAR  WITH THEM. THE BLACK DOTS ARE ACTUALLY  SHREDDED CAR AND TRUCK TIRES  USED IN FIELDS TO FILL THE SPACE BETWEEN ARTIFICIAL BLADES OF  GRASS. THEY CONTAIN ALL THE SAME  CHEMICALS FOUND IN MOST TIRES. THE INTERNATIONAL AGENCY FOR  CANCER RESEARCH LABELS FOUR  CARCINOGENS. WHILE ADDING THAT AT LOW LEVELS  OF EXPOSURE THERE ARE CONSIDERED SAFE. ON A SOCCER FIELD GOALKEEPERS  MORE THAN ANY OTHER PLAYER ROLL  AROUND ON THE TURF EVERY  PRACTICE.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; YOU DON&#39;T EAT TIRES. YET WE WERE. AS GOALIES OR PLAYERS, YOU WOULD GET IT IN YOUR MOUTH AND YOU  WOULDN&#39;T THINK ABOUT IT. &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Reporter: JORDAN STARTING  PLAYING GOALIE ON TURF WHEN SHE  WAS 12 YEARS OLD. SOME WEEKS IN HIGH SCHOOL  PRACTICING AS MANY AS 20 HOURS  OF CRUMB RUBBER. AT AGE 21 SHE WAS DIAGNOSED WITH NONHODGKINS LYMPHOMA.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; I DON&#39;T WANT ANYONE ELSE TO  HAVE TO GO THROUGH IT.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Reporter: THE FORMER GOALIE  IS ON THE LIST, NAMES THE COACH  CONTINUES TO GATHER OF PLAYERS  WHO DEVELOP DIFFERENT TYPES OF  CANCERS. 38 ALTOGETHER, 34 ARE SOCCER  PLAYERS. ANNIKA, 18 YEARS OLD, EMMA, 15. A LIST IS NO SCIENTIFIC PROOF. THERE&#39;S NO RESEARCH DIRECTLY  LINKING CHROME RUBBER EXPOSURE  TO CANCER.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; MANY ARE RELATED CANCERS, BUT THERE ARE OTHERS IN THERE TOO. WHAT I WOULD SAY IS IN GENERAL  IT&#39;S VERY DIFFICULT TO STUDY THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN AN  ENVIRONMENTAL EXPOSURE AND  CANCER.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Reporter: NO AVAILABLE  STUDIES REPLICATE GOALKEEPERS&#39;  PLAYING CONDITIONS. BUT MANY RESEARCHERS, STATES AND LOCALITIES DEFEND THE TURF  SAFETY. DAVIS LEE HAS A Ph.D. IN  CHEMISTRY AND SITS ON THE  SYNTHETIC TURF COUNCIL BOARD.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; THERE&#39;S CERTAINLY A  PREPONDERANCE OF THE EVIDENCE TO THIS POINT THAT SAYS IN FACT IT  IS SAFE.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Reporter: AN NBC NEWS  INVESTIGATION PUT THAT ASSERTION TO THE TEST. GATHERING AVAILABLE STUDIES AND  SPEAKING WITH PEDIATRICIANS,  SCIENTISTS AND ADVOCACY GROUPS  WHO SAY MORE RESEARCH SHOULD BE  DOWN.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; TURF FIELDS COME WITH A  NUMBER OF REAL RISKS AND A  NUMBER OF REAL BENEFITS. AND EVERY COMMUNITY THAT&#39;S BASED WITH DECIDING WHAT THEY WANT TO  PUT IN HAS TO KIND OF WEIGH IN  THE DIFFERENT RISKS AND BENEFITS FOR THAT SITUATION.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Reporter: AMONG THE AVAILABLE STUDIES THE SYNTHETIC TURF  COUNCIL POINTS TO IS ONE IN  2009. THE AGENCY ITSELF DESCRIBES THE  CONCLUSIONS AS LIMITED. NBC NEWS REPEATEDLY REQUESTED AN INTERVIEW, BUT AFTER SEVERAL  E-MAILS AND TWO PHONE CALLS, THE EPA REFUSED. IN A STATEMENT A SPOKESPERSON  SAYS THE USE OF CRUMB RUBBER  REMAINS A STATE AND LOCAL  DECISION. AND MORE TESTING NEEDS TO BE  DONE. IF MORE RESEARCH NEEDS TO BE  DONE, WHY ARE WE ALLOWING OUR  CHILDREN TO PLAY ON THIS  SURFACE? &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; SURE. WELL, MORE RESEARCH CAN ALWAYS  BE DONE. THE QUESTION IS WHETHER OR NOT  THE SYNTHETIC TURF IS SAFE. WE&#39;VE GOT 14 STUDIES ON OUR  WEBSITE THAT SAYS WE CAN FIND NO NEGATIVE HEALTH EFFECTS.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Reporter: PRO-ATHLETES AND  SCHOOL KIDS ALIKE ARE PLAYING ON MORE THAN 5,000 CRUMB RUBBER  FIELDS AROUND THE COUNTRY. AND THE FIELDS HAVE ALREADY  STIRRED SOME CONTROVERSY. THE NEW YORK CITY PARKS  DEPARTMENT AND THE LOS ANGELES  SCHOOL SYSTEM NO LONGER INSTALL  THE SURFACE CITING MULTIPLE  HEALTH CONCERNS. OTHER CITIES APPLAUD THE FIELDS  BECAUSE THEY SAY THE TURF IS  CHEAPER AND MORE DURABLE THAN  GRASS AND PROVIDES MORE OUTDOOR  SPACE FOR KIDS TO PLAY. BUT GRIFFIN WORRIES.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; I WOULD LOVE SOMEONE TO SAY  WE&#39;VE DONE SOME TESTS AND WE&#39;VE  COVERED ALL OF OUR BASES. AND, YES, IT&#39;S SAFE. AND THAT WOULD BE AWESOME. THAT WOULD BE GREAT.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; Reporter: YOU WANT TO BE  PROVED WRONG? &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; I WOULD LOVE TO BE PROVED  WRONG.  &#13;&#10;&gt;&gt; COACH GRIFFIN IS THE FIRST TO SAY SHE IS NOT A SCIENTIST AND  SHE TELLS ME THAT THE AWARENESS  RAISED ON THIS ISSUE WILL  GENERATE THE RESEARCH SHE AND  OTHERS THINK IS NEEDED.
