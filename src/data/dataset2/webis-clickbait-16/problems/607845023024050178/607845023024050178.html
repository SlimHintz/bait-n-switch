About Legalized Marijuana","date":1433724660000,"timestamp":1433782508478,"body":"<p>On Sunday night, '60 Minutes' revisited a story it had previously aired on the state of Colorado's legalized marijuana industry, going back to the state in order to get an update. The story gave a great broad overview of the industry, but by trying to cover so many parts of this <a href='http://www.forbes.com/business/'>business</a>, many things were missed.\r\n\r\nThe '60 Minutes' piece, called <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/videos/colorado-pot/\">'Colorado Pot,'</a> noted that it isn't easy to make money in legalized marijuana, but then like most of these general stories, zoomed in on the giant safe full of cash. The public assumes that because these businesses are awash in cash that they are profitable. That isn't necessarily the case. The story did touch on the seed-to-sale software, but didn't note that for the huge warehouse full of plants featured in the story, the software company could be charging anywhere from $0.25 to $0.45 an RFID or bar-code. These bar-codes can't be reused and a big warehouse like the one on the show that is growing thousands of plants is spending thousands for inventory tracking.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_3e6e10ebe3374d119df16e857494350b\" align=\"\" width=\"640\"]<img class=\"dam-image ap size-large wp-image-3e6e10ebe3374d119df16e857494350b\" src=\"http://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/3e6e10ebe3374d119df16e857494350b/640x0.jpg?fit=scale\" alt=\"\"> An unidentified pot reveler carries a modified version of the state flag of Colorado during activities on the unofficial marijuana holiday Monday, April 20, 2015, in Denver. A mass lighting marked the end of multiple days of festivities in Colorado. (AP Photo/David Zalubowski)[/caption]\r\n\r\nThe show was accurate in describing the difficulty these business owners face in finding a bank. Most of the major banks will not service these customers and some of the state chartered banks that were stepping in are now pulling back. First, they are concerned about the new Attorney General <a href='http://www.forbes.com/profile/loretta-lynch/'>Loretta Lynch</a> who is not for legalization. Secondly, it's expensive for the banks to handle these customers. The amount of employees required to fill out all the paperwork to keep the banks in compliance make these money losing customers. The banks have to fill out SARS paperwork or Suspicious Activity Reports on the accounts. This takes people and time and while these businesses may be swimming in cash, it doesn't pay off for the smaller banks. The big banks have said they won't allow this type of banking until marijuana is no longer illegal at the Federal level.\r\n\r\nThe major credit card companies [entity display=\"MasterCard\" type=\"organization\" subtype=\"company\" active=\"true\" key=\"mastercard\" ticker=\"MA\" exchange=\"NYSE\" natural_id=\"fred/company/2756\"]MasterCard[/entity] and [entity display=\"Visa\" type=\"organization\" subtype=\"company\" active=\"true\" key=\"visa\" ticker=\"V\" exchange=\"NYSE\" natural_id=\"fred/company/6238\"]Visa[/entity] both say they will not work with cannabis customers, but the dispensaries have figured out ways around this. Some have installed ATM machines or vending kiosks that make a plastic card transaction easier. Many of the dispensaries advertise that they can accept MasterCard and Visa, they just tweak the transactions so that it looks as if the customer is just making a withdrawal and then the cash is turned back over to the business.\r\n\r\nAnother issue for businesses is insurance. '60 Minutes' had probably prepared this story some time ago and maybe didn't have a chance to update it with the latest snag on insurance. Lloyds of London on Friday told its affiliates to no longer issue or renew policies for cannabis companies in the U.S. It covers quite a few of these businesses here and as many as 2,000 owners could be left without insurance. [entity display=\"Hannover Re\" type=\"organization\" subtype=\"company\" active=\"true\" key=\"hannover-re\" ticker=\"HVRRY\" exchange=\"Xetra\" natural_id=\"fred/company/1914\"]Hannover Re[/entity] a German insurer may be stepping in to pick up these policies, but like the banks that have stopped servicing these clients, the insurers may be scared off too.\r\n\r\n'60 Minutes' did a good job of describing how legalized marijuana was helping the state financially. There's even more to it than what the story told. <a href=\"http://mjbizdaily.com/\">Marijuana Business&nbsp;Daily</a> determined that for every $1 dollar of legally sold marijuana, a minimum of an additional $2.60 of economic value enters the American economy. A study conducted by the University of Denver economics professor Jack Strauss determined that a pair of retail marijuana stores could generate $30 million and deliver 280 new jobs and also pay $390,000 in city taxes. All these new jobs create people that need housing. For example, Denver&rsquo;s housing market is second only to San Francisco as being the hottest in the nation with prices rising 10% in March. You need people to build those houses and a cycle of prosperity begins.\r\n\r\nThere is also tourism. Colorado is seeing visitors to the state just because they want to buy pot legally. Sales of marijuana jump during spring break. These tourists increase hotel and restaurant revenue. Families with sick children that don't want to or can't wait for their state to legalize medical marijuana are moving to Colorado for their children.\r\n<!--nextpage-->\r\nThe '60 Minutes' program did make it clear that the legality of what Colorado has done by legalizing marijuana is tenuous. The new Attorney General Loretta Lynch isn't a fan of legalized marijuana and the program is correct in stating that some neighboring states are filing lawsuits asking for the legalization to be decided as unconstitutional. However, it seems as if the genie is already out of the bottle. 23 states have legalized marijuana and more are expected to join during the 2016 elections. Instead of fighting it, many states are salivating at the additional tax dollars and looking at how they can regulate the industry when it hits their state.\r\n\r\nPharmaceutical companies like GW Pharmaceuticals are asking the FDA to approve its cannabis-based drug and if that happens, it will automatically change the classification of cannabis as a dangerous drug, rendering it as legal as the pain killer vicodin. This could happen as soon as year end, thus effectively ending the legalization discussion and turning it into a regulatory one.\r\n\r\n<strong>Also on Forbes:</strong>\r\n\r\n[gallery2012]</p>","description":"'60 Minutes' revisited Colorado to see how the state is doing since it legalized marijuana, but they missed a few things.","image":"http://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/3e6e10ebe3374d119df16e857494350b/640x0.jpg?fit=scale","type":"blogslide","storyType":"post","uri":"http://www.forbes.com/sites/debraborchardt/2015/06/07/what-60-minutes-didnt-tell-you-about-legalized-marijuana/","comments":[],"visible":true,"blogId":"3632","authors":[{"naturalId":"blogAuthorId/blog/author/1632813","name":"Debra Borchardt","avatars":[{"size":136,"image":"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/21c959b15eab01846cd4a84fd9fe0329?s=136&amp;d=http%3A%2F%2F0.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2Fad516503a11cd5ca435acc9bb6523536%3Fs%3D136&amp;r=G"},{"size":40,"image":"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/21c959b15eab01846cd4a84fd9fe0329?s=40&amp;d=http%3A%2F%2F0.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2Fad516503a11cd5ca435acc9bb6523536%3Fs%3D40&amp;r=G"},{"size":400,"image":"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/21c959b15eab01846cd4a84fd9fe0329?s=400&amp;d=http%3A%2F%2F0.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2Fad516503a11cd5ca435acc9bb6523536%3Fs%3D400&amp;r=G"},{"size":62,"image":"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/21c959b15eab01846cd4a84fd9fe0329?s=62&amp;d=http%3A%2F%2F0.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2Fad516503a11cd5ca435acc9bb6523536%3Fs%3D62&amp;r=G"}],"url":"http://www.forbes.com/sites/debraborchardt/","type":"Contributor","profileUrl":"/sites/debraborchardt/","twitterName":"wallandbroad","authorType":"individual","email":"dborchardt@optonline.net","blog":false,"numFollowers":0,"shortBio":"I write about the business of marijuana.","timestamp":1445791641358,"description":"I spent over 15 years working in a variety of jobs in the securities \r\nindustry before getting my Masters Degree in Journalism at NYU.

My work in this area has been recognized with an AZBEE award for the video “Where People Want To Buy Pot.”","largeAvatar":"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/21c959b15eab01846cd4a84fd9fe0329?s=136&amp;d=http%3A%2F%2F0.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2Fad516503a11cd5ca435acc9bb6523536%3Fs%3D136&amp;r=G","largerAvatar":"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/21c959b15eab01846cd4a84fd9fe0329?s=400&amp;d=http%3A%2F%2F0.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2Fad516503a11cd5ca435acc9bb6523536%3Fs%3D400&amp;r=G","mediumAvatar":"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/21c959b15eab01846cd4a84fd9fe0329?s=62&amp;d=http%3A%2F%2F0.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2Fad516503a11cd5ca435acc9bb6523536%3Fs%3D62&amp;r=G","smallAvatar":"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/21c959b15eab01846cd4a84fd9fe0329?s=40&amp;d=http%3A%2F%2F0.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2Fad516503a11cd5ca435acc9bb6523536%3Fs%3D40&amp;r=G","largestAvatar":"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/21c959b15eab01846cd4a84fd9fe0329?s=400&amp;d=http%3A%2F%2F0.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2Fad516503a11cd5ca435acc9bb6523536%3Fs%3D400&amp;r=G"},"topics":["entrepreneurs","healthcare-innovation","social-impact","pharma-and-health","business","social-entrepreneurship","small-business-strategies","washington","taxes-and-law","retail","transformational-tech","startups","markets","powering-productivity"],"recentActivityCount":2,"latestActivityDate":1445601600000,"dailyActivityCount":0,"displayChannel":"business","shortUri":"http://onforb.es/1Mwox79","slug":"debraborchardt","contributorSince":1426187400000,"showNoVestPocket":false,"embargo":false,"enableContribContact":false,"enableTwitterFeed":false,"disableCanonical":false,"disableDigest":false}],"channelSection":[{"channelId":"channel_1"},{"channelId":"channel_4"},{"channelId":"channel_1","sectionId":"section_59"},{"channelId":"channel_4","sectionId":"section_142"},{"channelId":"channel_4","sectionId":"section_26"}],"slug":"business","blogType":"individual","slides":[{"image":"/imageserve/44d6b4d1d49f7420f1dbcec983a1abc4/640x434.jpg?fit=scale&background=000000","uri":"/pictures/gjgf45egm/10-best-cities-for-young","shortUri":"http://onforb.es/1KOXS3U","caption":"<p>NerdWallet tallied the top metro areas by population to determine this (surprising!) list of the best cities for young founders.

it had previously aired on the state of Colorado’s legalized marijuana industry, going back to the state in order to get an update. The story gave a great broad overview of the industry, but by trying to cover so many parts of this <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/business/\" target=\"_self\">business</a>, many things were missed.</p>\n<p>The ’60 Minutes’ piece, called <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/videos/colorado-pot/\">‘Colorado Pot,’</a> noted that it isn’t easy to make money in legalized marijuana, but then like most of these general stories, zoomed in on the giant safe full of cash. The public assumes that because these businesses are awash in cash that they are profitable. That isn’t necessarily the case. The story did touch on the seed-to-sale software, but didn’t note that for the huge warehouse full of plants featured in the story, the software company could be charging anywhere from $0.25 to $0.45 an RFID or bar-code. These bar-codes can’t be reused and a big warehouse like the one on the show that is growing thousands of plants is spending thousands for inventory tracking.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_3e6e10ebe3374d119df16e857494350b\"> \n <img class=\"dam-image ap size-large wp-image-3e6e10ebe3374d119df16e857494350b\" src=\"http://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/3e6e10ebe3374d119df16e857494350b/640x0.jpg?fit=scale\" alt=\"\" /> \n <p class=\"wp-caption-text\">An unidentified pot reveler carries a modified version of the state flag of Colorado during activities on the unofficial marijuana holiday Monday, April 20, 2015, in Denver. A mass lighting marked the end of multiple days of festivities in Colorado. (AP Photo/David Zalubowski)</p> \n</div>\n<p>The show was accurate in describing the difficulty these business owners face in finding a bank. Most of the major banks will not service these customers and some of the state chartered banks that were stepping in are now pulling back. First, they are concerned about the new Attorney General <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/profile/loretta-lynch/\" target=\"_self\">Loretta Lynch</a> who is not for legalization. Secondly, it’s expensive for the banks to handle these customers. The amount of employees required to fill out all the paperwork to keep the banks in compliance make these money losing customers. The banks have to fill out SARS paperwork or Suspicious Activity Reports on the accounts. This takes people and time and while these businesses may be swimming in cash, it doesn’t pay off for the smaller banks. The big banks have said they won’t allow this type of banking until marijuana is no longer illegal at the Federal level.</p>\n<div id=\"inread\" article-ad-inbody=\"inread\" class=\"inread\"></div>\n<p>The major credit card companies <span class=\"quotecard\" article-quote-card=\"\" data-ticker=\"MA\" data-exchange=\"NYSE\" data-type=\"organization\" data-naturalid=\"fred/company/2756\" data-quotes-closing=\"98.02\" data-quotes-now=\"99.79\" data-link=\"/companies/mastercard\" data-name=\"MasterCard\"></span> and <span class=\"quotecard\" article-quote-card=\"\" data-ticker=\"V\" data-exchange=\"NYSE\" data-type=\"organization\" data-naturalid=\"fred/company/6238\" data-quotes-closing=\"76.42\" data-quotes-now=\"77.07\" data-link=\"/companies/visa\" data-name=\"Visa\"></span> both say they will not work with cannabis customers, but the dispensaries have figured out ways around this. Some have installed ATM machines or vending kiosks that make a plastic card transaction easier. Many of the dispensaries advertise that they can accept MasterCard and Visa, they just tweak the transactions so that it looks as if the customer is just making a withdrawal and then the cash is turned back over to the business.</p>\n<p>Another issue for businesses is insurance. ’60 Minutes’ had probably prepared this story some time ago and maybe didn’t have a chance to update it with the latest snag on insurance. Lloyds of London on Friday told its affiliates to no longer issue or renew policies for cannabis companies in the U.S. It covers quite a few of these businesses here and as many as 2,000 owners could be left without insurance. <span class=\"quotecard\" article-quote-card=\"\" data-ticker=\"HVRRY\" data-exchange=\"Xetra\" data-type=\"organization\" data-naturalid=\"fred/company/1914\" data-quotes-closing=\"0.0\" data-quotes-now=\"0.0\" data-link=\"/companies/hannover-re\" data-name=\"Hannover Re\"></span> a German insurer may be stepping in to pick up these policies, but like the banks that have stopped servicing these clients, the insurers may be scared off too.</p>\n<div class=\"vestpocket\" vest-pocket=\"\"></div>\n<p>’60 Minutes’ did a good job of describing how legalized marijuana was helping the state financially. There’s even more to it than what the story told. <a href=\"http://mjbizdaily.com/\">Marijuana Business&nbsp;Daily</a> determined that for every $1 dollar of legally sold marijuana, a minimum of an additional $2.60 of economic value enters the American economy. A study conducted by the University of Denver economics professor Jack Strauss determined that a pair of retail marijuana stores could generate $30 million and deliver 280 new jobs and also pay $390,000 in city taxes. All these new jobs create people that need housing. For example, Denver’s housing market is second only to San Francisco as being the hottest in the nation with prices rising 10% in March. You need people to build those houses and a cycle of prosperity begins.</p>\n<p>There is also tourism. Colorado is seeing visitors to the state just because they want to buy pot legally. Sales of marijuana jump during spring break. These tourists increase hotel and restaurant revenue. Families with sick children that don’t want to or can’t wait for their state to legalize medical marijuana are moving to Colorado for their children.</p>","<p>The ’60 Minutes’ program did make it clear that the legality of what Colorado has done by legalizing marijuana is tenuous. The new Attorney General Loretta Lynch isn’t a fan of legalized marijuana and the program is correct in stating that some neighboring states are filing lawsuits asking for the legalization to be decided as unconstitutional. However, it seems as if the genie is already out of the bottle. 23 states have legalized marijuana and more are expected to join during the 2016 elections. Instead of fighting it, many states are salivating at the additional tax dollars and looking at how they can regulate the industry when it hits their state.</p>\n<p>Pharmaceutical companies like GW Pharmaceuticals are asking the FDA to approve its cannabis-based drug and if that happens, it will automatically change the classification of cannabis as a dangerous drug, rendering it as legal as the pain killer vicodin. This could happen as soon as year end, thus effectively ending the legalization discussion and turning it into a regulatory one.</p>\n<p><strong>Also on Forbes:</strong></p>\n<div class=\"article-gallery-embedded\" data-url=\"http://www.forbes.com/pictures/gjgf45egm/10-best-cities-for-young/\"> \n <div class=\"embedded-content clearfix\"> \n  <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/pictures/gjgf45egm/10-best-cities-for-young/\" class=\"clearfix\" target=\"_self\"> \n   <div class=\"article-image-box\"> \n    <!--start:main_image--> \n    <img src=\"http://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/44d6b4d1d49f7420f1dbcec983a1abc4/400x400.jpg?fit=scale&amp;background=000000\" alt=\"\" /> \n    <!--end:main_image--> \n   </div> \n   <div class=\"article-text-box\"> \n    <header> \n     <i class=\"icon icon-gallery\"></i>Gallery \n    </header> \n    <h4>The 10 Best Cities For Young Entrepreneurs</h4> \n    <div class=\"article-launch-gallery\"> \n     <span class=\"article-launch-text\">Launch Gallery</span> \n     <div class=\"article-slide-count\">\n       11 images \n     </div> \n    </div> \n    <button class=\"article-launch-button\"><i class=\"icon icon-chevron-right\"></i></button> \n   </div></a> \n </div> \n</div>"],"galleryId":"54f4e70cda47a54de8244e3a","disableDigest":false,"writtenByForbesStaff":false,"channelSectionMappings":[{"id":"channel_1","channelName":"Business","url":"/business"},{"id":"channel_1section_59","channelName":"Business","sectionName":"Retail","url":"/retail"},{"id":"channel_4","channelName":"Entrepreneurs","url":"/entrepreneurs"},{"id":"channel_4section_142","channelName":"Entrepreneurs","sectionName":"Small Business Strategies","url":"/small-business-strategies"},{"id":"channel_4section_26","channelName":"Entrepreneurs","sectionName":"Taxes & Law","url":"/taxes-law"}],"digestDisabled":false,"brandVoiceTitle":"What '60 Minutes' Didn't Tell You About Legalized Marijuana","groupAuthor":{"naturalId":"blogAuthorId/blog/author/blog-3632","avatars":[{"size":0},{"size":0},{"size":0},{"size":0}],"url":"http://www.forbes.com/sites/debraborchardt/","profileUrl":"http://blogs.forbes.com/debraborchardt/profile/","authorType":"individual","blog":true,"numFollowers":0,"timestamp":1445791430492,"primaryBlogNaturalId":"blogAuthorId/blog/author/blog-3632","primaryContributor":"blogAuthorId/blog/author/1632813","primaryContributorData":{"naturalId":"blogAuthorId/blog/author/1632813","name":"Debra Borchardt","avatars":[{"size":40,"image":"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/21c959b15eab01846cd4a84fd9fe0329?s=40&amp;d=http%3A%2F%2F0.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2Fad516503a11cd5ca435acc9bb6523536%3Fs%3D40&amp;r=G"},{"size":62,"image":"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/21c959b15eab01846cd4a84fd9fe0329?s=62&amp;d=http%3A%2F%2F0.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2Fad516503a11cd5ca435acc9bb6523536%3Fs%3D62&amp;r=G"},{"size":136,"image":"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/21c959b15eab01846cd4a84fd9fe0329?s=136&amp;d=http%3A%2F%2F0.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2Fad516503a11cd5ca435acc9bb6523536%3Fs%3D136&amp;r=G"},{"size":400,"image":"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/21c959b15eab01846cd4a84fd9fe0329?s=400&amp;d=http%3A%2F%2F0.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2Fad516503a11cd5ca435acc9bb6523536%3Fs%3D400&amp;r=G"}],"blog":false,"numFollowers":0,"shortBio":"I write about the business of marijuana.","description":"I spent over 15 years working in a variety of jobs in the securities \r\nindustry before getting my Masters Degree in Journalism at NYU.
