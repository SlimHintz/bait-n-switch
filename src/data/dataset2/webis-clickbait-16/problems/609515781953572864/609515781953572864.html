After all, millennials have taken on more student debt than any previous generation. In fact, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York reported an increase of over <a href=\"http://res.dallasnews.com/interactives/generation-of-debt/employment/\">$500 billion in student debt</a> over the last eight years alone. While many people seem to love stereotyping millennials as a generation full of jobless, homeless, indebted coach surfers, a new millennial segment is fueling a different story.\r\n\r\n<strong>Meet the affluent millennials.</strong>\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_297\" align=\"\" width=\"720\"]<a href=\"http://www.millennialmarketing.com/2015/06/affluent-millennials-skew-more-female-and-some-eschew-college-education/\"><img class=\"wp-image-297 size-full\" src=\"http://blogs-images.forbes.com/jefffromm/files/2015/06/am-segments.png\" alt=\"am segments\"></a> AFFUENT MILLENNIAL SEGMENTS SOURCE: Leah Swartz and Jeff Fromm, &ldquo;Money Matters: How Affluent Millennials are Living the American Dream,&rdquo; FutureCast&reg;&nbsp;and Consumer Orbit Study 2015[/caption]\r\n\r\nCurrently, there are over 6.2 million millennials aged 18-34 with annual household incomes over $100,000. However, these millennials don&rsquo;t all look the same. There are four unique segments of this group that differ not just in demographics, but behaviors and attitudes as well. What&rsquo;s important to recognize about this group is that while they only account for less than 10 percent of the 18-34-year-old population, they hold a huge influence over the entire millennial generation in both dollars and impact.\r\n\r\nIt&rsquo;s safe to say that affluent millennials are a group of consumers who are constantly on the move. In order to command such a high income, it makes sense that they lead busy lifestyles. However, affluent millennials are busy, not just because of the strides they are making in their careers, but also because many of them are checking off major milestones in their personal lives. Many affluent millennials are transitioning into married life and starting families of their own. Fifty seven percent of affluent millennials are currently married and six percent are currently engaged. These figures are significantly higher than nonaffluent millennials, who are also less likely than affluent millennials to be expecting a child in the next 12 months.\r\n\r\nFor brands, this means that as soon as all these changes take place, affluent adults will be settling into a new lifestyle with altered buying habits. Similar to a rock thrown into the sand displacing all the grains, everything will ultimately settle back into place in a new order.\r\n\r\n<strong>Affluent millennials are the millennial trendsetters</strong>\r\n\r\nPart of what has made the millennial generation so important to modern brands is their influence on the general population of millennials. We often look to millennials as the influencers for the general consumer market, but who are the influencers among millennials themselves?\r\n\r\nLooking at millennials with affluence, it&rsquo;s very apparent that this group is the one fueling millennial trends because of their ability to act on millennial aspirations. Unlike nonaffluent millennials who often say one thing and act differently (most millennials will say they buy organic but then run through the store register with the off-brand peanut butter), affluent millennials are unfettered from issues of general affordability. They do not have to trade up or trade down; they simple buy the things they want. Essentially, they can buy the products and services that fit their general Millennial Mindset&reg; &ndash; fresh, organic, fast, high quality &ndash; and do not have to trade up to get it. They can take the great adventures, chart the less traveled paths and embrace the risks they wish to pursue.\r\n\r\n<!--nextpage-->\r\n\r\n<strong>Activating affluent millennials</strong>\r\n\r\nSo how can brands engage this highly influential cohort of millennials? Our research shows that compared to nonaffluent millennials, affluent millennials feel more confident in their decisions and don&rsquo;t require as much hands on assistance from brands. The goal for brands connecting with affluent millennials is to maintain a hands-off marketing approach and instead be available for consumers when they need them, acting as a critical resource instead of noise. This is especially true for brands in the financial industry. &nbsp;As affluent millennials continue to gain wealth, they place high value on brands that will help them secure their financial assets and are more likely than nonaffluent millennials to seek out quality financial advice regardless of cost.\r\n\r\nSince millennials in general are creatures of content, there is a huge opportunity for financial institutions to reach this increasingly growing segment with information and tips for how to spend and save for their futures. [entity display=\"Charles Schwab\" type=\"organization\" subtype=\"company\" active=\"true\" key=\"charles-schwab\" ticker=\"SCHW\" exchange=\"NYSE\" natural_id=\"fred/company/3783\"]Charles Schwab[/entity] is a brand that has won over affluent millennials through useful content. In comparison to other brands in the financial services sector, Charles Schwab ranks significantly higher in regard to Quality and Reputation among affluent millennials. This is due in large part to the attention the company had paid to creating an engaging platform for young adults with high incomes.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.thestreet.com/video/13158823/schwab-intelligent-portfolios-pulling-in-more-than-millennials.html\">Charles Schwab recently created an automated investing service</a> that embraces tech-savvy consumers who are looking for easier and more transparent accessibility, but also looking for help and tips on the market. This type of relationship is key for affluent millennials because it established Charles Schwab as a resource for affluent consumers with the goal of empowering their financial decisions rather than taking the reigns and making decisions <em>for</em> them.\r\n\r\nOther brands like [entity display=\"American Express\" type=\"organization\" subtype=\"company\" active=\"true\" key=\"american-express\" ticker=\"AXP\" exchange=\"NYSE\" natural_id=\"fred/company/213\"]American Express[/entity], Uber, Venmo and [entity display=\"Bose\" type=\"organization\" subtype=\"company\" active=\"true\" key=\"bose\" natural_id=\"fred/company/12694\"]Bose[/entity] Sound System have won over affluent millennials through empowerment and attention to the entrepreneurial spirit of affluent young adults. These brands understand that unlike nonaffluent millennials, those making more than $100k annually have a greater aptitude to make their own financial purchase decisions. By creating an environment where the quality of the product speaks louder than the actual brand messages and by offering clear proof regarding their brand story they are creating more unique and meaningful brands and brand experiences.\r\n\r\nOverall, affluent millennials are a small but very powerful millennial segment. Their actions and behaviors continue to fuel the Millennial Mindset&reg; and their purchase decisions are reflections of how many millennials aspire to one day build their own lives. These young adults are putting millennial aspirations into action and their money is doing all the talking. If you want to talk with them, you will have to embrace a new customer relationship model that strays from the traditional hands-on approach.\r\n\r\n<em>Disclaimer</em>: I recently completed an in depth behavioral and attitudinal study of affluent millennials for FutureCast&reg; not on behalf of a specific client.

While many people seem to love stereotyping millennials as a generation full of jobless, homeless, indebted coach surfers, a new millennial segment is fueling a different story.</p>\n<p><strong>Meet the affluent millennials.</strong></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_297\"> \n <a href=\"http://www.millennialmarketing.com/2015/06/affluent-millennials-skew-more-female-and-some-eschew-college-education/\"><img class=\"wp-image-297 size-full\" src=\"http://blogs-images.forbes.com/jefffromm/files/2015/06/am-segments.png\" alt=\"am segments\" /></a> \n <p class=\"wp-caption-text\">AFFUENT MILLENNIAL SEGMENTS SOURCE: Leah Swartz and Jeff Fromm, “Money Matters: How Affluent Millennials are Living the American Dream,” FutureCast&reg;&nbsp;and Consumer Orbit Study 2015</p> \n</div>\n<p>Currently, there are over 6.2 million millennials aged 18-34 with annual household incomes over $100,000. However, these millennials don’t all look the same. There are four unique segments of this group that differ not just in demographics, but behaviors and attitudes as well. What’s important to recognize about this group is that while they only account for less than 10 percent of the 18-34-year-old population, they hold a huge influence over the entire millennial generation in both dollars and impact.</p>\n<p>It’s safe to say that affluent millennials are a group of consumers who are constantly on the move. In order to command such a high income, it makes sense that they lead busy lifestyles. However, affluent millennials are busy, not just because of the strides they are making in their careers, but also because many of them are checking off major milestones in their personal lives. Many affluent millennials are transitioning into married life and starting families of their own. Fifty seven percent of affluent millennials are currently married and six percent are currently engaged. These figures are significantly higher than nonaffluent millennials, who are also less likely than affluent millennials to be expecting a child in the next 12 months.</p>\n<div id=\"inread\" article-ad-inbody=\"inread\" class=\"inread\"></div>\n<p>For brands, this means that as soon as all these changes take place, affluent adults will be settling into a new lifestyle with altered buying habits. Similar to a rock thrown into the sand displacing all the grains, everything will ultimately settle back into place in a new order.</p>\n<p><strong>Affluent millennials are the millennial trendsetters</strong></p>\n<p>Part of what has made the millennial generation so important to modern brands is their influence on the general population of millennials. We often look to millennials as the influencers for the general consumer market, but who are the influencers among millennials themselves?</p>\n<div class=\"vestpocket\" vest-pocket=\"\"></div>\n<p>Looking at millennials with affluence, it’s very apparent that this group is the one fueling millennial trends because of their ability to act on millennial aspirations. Unlike nonaffluent millennials who often say one thing and act differently (most millennials will say they buy organic but then run through the store register with the off-brand peanut butter), affluent millennials are unfettered from issues of general affordability. They do not have to trade up or trade down; they simple buy the things they want. Essentially, they can buy the products and services that fit their general Millennial Mindset&reg; – fresh, organic, fast, high quality – and do not have to trade up to get it. They can take the great adventures, chart the less traveled paths and embrace the risks they wish to pursue.</p>","<p><strong>Activating affluent millennials</strong></p>\n<p>So how can brands engage this highly influential cohort of millennials? Our research shows that compared to nonaffluent millennials, affluent millennials feel more confident in their decisions and don’t require as much hands on assistance from brands. The goal for brands connecting with affluent millennials is to maintain a hands-off marketing approach and instead be available for consumers when they need them, acting as a critical resource instead of noise. This is especially true for brands in the financial industry. &nbsp;As affluent millennials continue to gain wealth, they place high value on brands that will help them secure their financial assets and are more likely than nonaffluent millennials to seek out quality financial advice regardless of cost.</p>\n<p>Since millennials in general are creatures of content, there is a huge opportunity for financial institutions to reach this increasingly growing segment with information and tips for how to spend and save for their futures. <span class=\"quotecard\" article-quote-card=\"\" data-ticker=\"SCHW\" data-exchange=\"NYSE\" data-type=\"organization\" data-naturalid=\"fred/company/3783\" data-quotes-closing=\"29.45\" data-quotes-now=\"30.43\" data-link=\"/companies/charles-schwab\" data-name=\"Charles Schwab\"></span> is a brand that has won over affluent millennials through useful content. In comparison to other brands in the financial services sector, Charles Schwab ranks significantly higher in regard to Quality and Reputation among affluent millennials. This is due in large part to the attention the company had paid to creating an engaging platform for young adults with high incomes.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thestreet.com/video/13158823/schwab-intelligent-portfolios-pulling-in-more-than-millennials.html\">Charles Schwab recently created an automated investing service</a> that embraces tech-savvy consumers who are looking for easier and more transparent accessibility, but also looking for help and tips on the market. This type of relationship is key for affluent millennials because it established Charles Schwab as a resource for affluent consumers with the goal of empowering their financial decisions rather than taking the reigns and making decisions <em>for</em> them.</p>\n<div id=\"inread\" article-ad-inbody=\"inread\" class=\"inread\"></div>\n<p>Other brands like <span class=\"quotecard\" article-quote-card=\"\" data-ticker=\"AXP\" data-exchange=\"NYSE\" data-type=\"organization\" data-naturalid=\"fred/company/213\" data-quotes-closing=\"72.5\" data-quotes-now=\"74.59\" data-link=\"/companies/american-express\" data-name=\"American Express\"></span>, Uber, Venmo and <span class=\"quotecard\" article-quote-card=\"\" data-ticker=\"null\" data-exchange=\"null\" data-type=\"organization\" data-naturalid=\"fred/company/12694\" data-quotes-closing=\"0.0\" data-quotes-now=\"0.0\" data-link=\"/companies/bose\" data-name=\"Bose\"></span> Sound System have won over affluent millennials through empowerment and attention to the entrepreneurial spirit of affluent young adults. These brands understand that unlike nonaffluent millennials, those making more than $100k annually have a greater aptitude to make their own financial purchase decisions. By creating an environment where the quality of the product speaks louder than the actual brand messages and by offering clear proof regarding their brand story they are creating more unique and meaningful brands and brand experiences.</p>\n<p>Overall, affluent millennials are a small but very powerful millennial segment. Their actions and behaviors continue to fuel the Millennial Mindset&reg; and their purchase decisions are reflections of how many millennials aspire to one day build their own lives. These young adults are putting millennial aspirations into action and their money is doing all the talking. If you want to talk with them, you will have to embrace a new customer relationship model that strays from the traditional hands-on approach.</p>\n<div class=\"vestpocket\" vest-pocket=\"\"></div>\n<p><em>Disclaimer</em>: I recently completed an in depth behavioral and attitudinal study of affluent millennials for FutureCast&reg; not on behalf of a specific client.
