So is Sara Blakely, the founder of Spanx. They didn&rsquo;t grow up with money or the finer things in life, they weren&rsquo;t offered &ldquo;legacy&rdquo; preferences for college, and they didn&rsquo;t get a trophy on the soccer field just because they showed up. They worked hard and found their support through family, teachers and mentors.\r\n\r\nBut what makes them tick? That's what I wanted to know.\r\n\r\nAndrea Guendelman, cofounder and CEO of&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.bevisible.soy/\">BeVisible</a>, was curious as well, so together we asked the women we&rsquo;re featuring in our <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/deniserestauri/2015/03/19/from-murder-to-the-mayors-office-a-story-of-grit-and-excellence/\">Self-Made Women</a> series what they believe are the top 10 traits of successful self-made women.

When you come across a self-made woman, you can feel it in her presence. She exudes an undeniable energy of conviction and resolve. It&rsquo;s almost as if she&rsquo;s always in the &lsquo;on&rsquo; state, ready and open to anything. --<em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/apolack\">Amira Polack</a> (25) Youth Campaign Lead at SAP</em>\r\n\r\n<strong>Self-aware. </strong>Self-made women are aware of&nbsp;who&nbsp;they are and have made meaning from the experiences that have shaped their worldview.Heightened self-awareness provides them with clarity, both personally and professionally, and this helps them to align their goals and objectives to their purpose and meaning. That&rsquo;s a powerful combination. --<em><a href=\"http://rumeetbillan.com/\">Rumeet Billan</a> (31) Social Entrepreneur &amp; President, Jobs in Education</em>\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_8034\" align=\"\" width=\"700\"]<img class=\"size-full wp-image-8034\" src=\"http://blogs-images.forbes.com/deniserestauri/files/2015/06/G0A0235-e1434050231174.jpg\" alt=\"Sara Blakely, Founder of Spanx is a self-made woman. \"> Sara Blakely, Founder of Spanx is a self-made woman.[/caption]\r\n\r\n<strong>Visionary.</strong>&nbsp;Self-made women are able to see beyond the way things are and create something new.<span class=\"tweet_icon\"></span> They are able to see opportunities where others see obstacles and unfairness. And while others often get taken out by what seems impossible, self-made women are inspired into action to construct a new reality no matter how deep or systemic the scraps. --<em><a href=\"https://farmcommons.org/\">Rachel Armstrong</a> (34) Founder, Executive Director and Attorney at Farm Commons</em>\r\n\r\n<strong>Self-forgiving.</strong> Self-made women look at the past, the darkest moments and poorest choices with compassion, knowing they did the best they could with the resources and tools at the time. They release the weight of regretful actions and free themselves from judgment.--<em><a href=\"http://www.originmagazine.com\">Maranda Pleasant</a> (36), Founder/Editor-in-Chief ORIGIN Magazine, Mantra Yoga + Health Magazine, Thrive Magazine&nbsp;</em>\r\n</p><div style=\"padding: 20px 0pt;margin: 20px 0pt;border-bottom: 1px solid #DDDDDD;border-top: 1px solid #DDDDDD\"><a style=\"text-decoration: none;color: #900;font: bold 20px/26px Georgia\" href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Their-Roaring-Thirties-Brutally-Honest-ebook/dp/B00NG0SHJW/?utm_source=articlelink&amp;utm_medium=direct&amp;utm_campaign=thirtiesebook\">Their Roaring Thirties: A Forbes eBook</a>\r\n<a style=\"text-decoration: none;font: 15px/18px  Georgia;color: #000\" href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Their-Roaring-Thirties-Brutally-Honest-ebook/dp/B00NG0SHJW/?utm_source=articlelink&amp;utm_medium=direct&amp;utm_campaign=thirtiesebook\"><em>Brutally Honest Career Talk From Women Who Beat The Youth Trap</em> spotlights the trials and triumphs that thirtysomething women face.

[tweet_quote display=\"Successful self-made women know when to say &lsquo;yes&rsquo;, but more importantly, they know when to say &lsquo;no&rsquo;.\"]They know when to say &lsquo;yes&rsquo;, but more importantly, they know when to say &lsquo;no&rsquo;[/tweet_quote] . --<em><a href=\"http://tealmedia.com/\">Jessica Teal</a> (38) Principal, Teal Media</em>\r\n<!--nextpage-->\r\n<strong>Resourceful. </strong>Self-made women are resourceful. They don&rsquo;t see the lack of time, money, support, or anything else as an end. Rather, they see it as an opportunity to become even more determined to get the job done. More than anyone else, they are able to navigate roadblocks to find creative solutions to their challenges. -- <em><a href=\"http://www.financiallywisewomen.com/\">Brittney Castro</a> (30), CFP, CRPC, AAMS. Founder and CEO, Financially Wise Women</em>\r\n\r\n<strong>Passionate.</strong> I&rsquo;ve never met a self-made woman who wasn&rsquo;t passionate. And this passion -- whether it&rsquo;s about money, success, making an impact, or the cause they&rsquo;re fighting for &ndash; is what drives them forward faster and more deliberately than their peers. --<em><a href=\"https://www.globalglimpse.org/\">Eliza Pesuit</a>, 30, Executive Director of Global Glimpse&nbsp;</em>\r\n\r\n<strong>Comfortable Being Uncomfortable.&nbsp;</strong>Self-made women have learned that being successful isn't a cake walk- that it&rsquo;s often tough, scary, frustrating, and certainly lonely.&nbsp;They also know these feelings and experiences are part of the process of building anything and have learned to get comfortable with the uncomfortable. --<em><a href=\"http://ingridvanderveldt.com/\">Ingrid&nbsp;Vanderveldt</a> (44) founder and CEO Ingrid Vanderveldt LLC, EBW2020</em>\r\n\r\n<strong>Collaborative Intelligence. </strong>Self-made women are typically intellectually diverse -- meaning they have an acute ability to read people, relate to and embrace all types of people, and understand how to collaborate with those who bring a variety of opinions, experiences, beliefs and politics to the table. They are able to focus on issues and get goals accomplished without getting taken out by emotionally charged conflicts. <em><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/pub/maria-l-chrin/72/173/542\">Maria L. Chrin</a></em><em>&nbsp;</em><em>(50) Managing Partner, Circle Wealth Management, LLC</em>\r\n\r\n<strong>Forward Momentum.</strong> Self-made women are masters at recognizing and seizing opportunities, assessing risks and taking chances. They also know that shipping [starting, finishing, and iterating on products] is the path to achievement.
