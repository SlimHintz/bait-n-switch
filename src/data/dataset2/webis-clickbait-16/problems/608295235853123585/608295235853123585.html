Give Up Khaki Pants","date":1433797560000,"timestamp":1433857221012,"body":"<p>Last week Walmart made news when it announced that many of its workers will no longer have to wear the collared shirts and khaki trousers the retailing giant had required for decades.\r\n\r\nEmployees have been complaining about their dress code off and on for a year on social media as well as on an internal Walmart website, where some employees posted comments that were leaked to <a href=\"http://gawker.com/walmart-workers-rant-about-the-nonsense-new-dress-cod-1629620241\">Gawker </a>earlier this year. &ldquo;I used to absolutely love my job and now I pray every night that I can find another one and leave this one,&rdquo; an associate wrote on the website, according to Gawker. &ldquo;It is pretty bad that my full time job is a[n] administrative assistant in a law office and I can wear jeans there, but I can't wear jeans in a grocery store.&rdquo; According to Kory Lundberg, director of media relations for Walmart, employees&mdash;particularly those working behind the scenes to unload trucks and man the garden centers&mdash;had wanted a little more flexibility in what they wore as the hot summer months approached.\r\n\r\nWalmart is now making a slew of changes designed to placate employees, including alterations to the music selections and thermostat temperatures in stores across the country. The announcements came at its annual shareholder meeting, which wrapped up on Friday. Among the new policies is a more relaxed dress code. Not only can workers with physically taxing jobs now wear jeans and t-shirts, but employees out front can also wear denim as long as it is khaki or black.\r\n\r\nThough the change may seem trivial, it marks a turning point in the history of the chain.\r\n\r\nKhaki had a long legacy even before it was adopted by Walmart. It was invented for the military in the mid-nineteenth century when British Lieutenant Sir Harry Lumsden decided to create a new uniform for British soldiers in Pakistan. Faced with an unfamiliar climate and enemy, he abandoned the crimson garb that British soldiers had always worn for a looser garment whose color, a drab brownish tan, blended into the dusty landscape. Khaki was later popularized in the United States during WWII when American troops wore it in combat and brought their freshly pressed pants back to the United States.\r\n\r\nSam Walton, the founder of Walmart, was one of those soldiers. He left the army in 1945 and returned to Bentonville, Arkansas, where he bought the small Ben Franklin variety store that would eventually give birth to Walmart, the largest employer in the United States today.\r\n\r\nTo set his rural Arkansas customers at ease, Walton made sure the people who worked at Walmart looked like the people they were serving. Khaki pants&mdash;then worn by war veterans and movie stars, farmers and city slickers alike&mdash;were the best way to make employees look approachable.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;It was frequently difficult to distinguish who was staff and who was a customer,&rdquo; says Bethany Moreton, author of To Serve God and Wal-Mart. &ldquo;But that wasn&rsquo;t necessarily a problem because there was a very self-conscious effort [by Walmart] to make them relatively homogenous.&rdquo;\r\n\r\nOther companies have embraced similar dress codes over the years. Don Tyson, the founder of [entity display=\"Tyson Foods\" type=\"organization\" subtype=\"company\" active=\"true\" key=\"tyson-foods\" ticker=\"TSN\" exchange=\"NYSE\" natural_id=\"fred/company/4466\"]Tyson Foods[/entity], initiated an all-khaki uniform for his employees. And as Tyson built his company from a small chicken processing plant to the behemoth it is today, he often wore the company uniform with his name, Don, emblazoned on the upper right shoulder.\r\n\r\nFor Walmart, the initial advantages of a khaki uniform have vanished. The company began looking for ways to make its employees stand out rather than blend in with customers. Last fall it started asking employees to wear a standard Walmart vest to make them identifiable for shoppers. It was only a matter of time before the chain let its employees leave their khakis at home.\r\n\r\n<em><strong>Also on Forbes:</strong></em>\r\n\r\n[gallery2012]\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<!--donotpaginate--></p>","description":"Last week Walmart made news when it announced that many of its workers will no longer have to wear the collared shirts and khaki trousers the retailing giant had required for decades.

The announcements came at its annual shareholder meeting, which wrapped up on Friday. Among the new policies is a more relaxed dress code. Not only can workers with physically taxing jobs now wear jeans and t-shirts, but employees out front can also wear denim as long as it is khaki or black.</p>\n<p>Though the change may seem trivial, it marks a turning point in the history of the chain.</p>\n<p>Khaki had a long legacy even before it was adopted by Walmart. It was invented for the military in the mid-nineteenth century when British Lieutenant Sir Harry Lumsden decided to create a new uniform for British soldiers in Pakistan. Faced with an unfamiliar climate and enemy, he abandoned the crimson garb that British soldiers had always worn for a looser garment whose color, a drab brownish tan, blended into the dusty landscape. Khaki was later popularized in the United States during WWII when American troops wore it in combat and brought their freshly pressed pants back to the United States.</p>\n<div id=\"inread\" article-ad-inbody=\"inread\" class=\"inread\"></div>\n<p>Sam Walton, the founder of Walmart, was one of those soldiers. He left the army in 1945 and returned to Bentonville, Arkansas, where he bought the small Ben Franklin variety store that would eventually give birth to Walmart, the largest employer in the United States today.</p>\n<p>To set his rural Arkansas customers at ease, Walton made sure the people who worked at Walmart looked like the people they were serving. Khaki pants—then worn by war veterans and movie stars, farmers and city slickers alike—were the best way to make employees look approachable.</p>\n<div class=\"vestpocket\" vest-pocket=\"\"></div>\n<p>“It was frequently difficult to distinguish who was staff and who was a customer,” says Bethany Moreton, author of To Serve God and Wal-Mart. “But that wasn’t necessarily a problem because there was a very self-conscious effort [by Walmart] to make them relatively homogenous.”</p>\n<p>Other companies have embraced similar dress codes over the years. Don Tyson, the founder of <span class=\"quotecard\" article-quote-card=\"\" data-ticker=\"TSN\" data-exchange=\"NYSE\" data-type=\"organization\" data-naturalid=\"fred/company/4466\" data-quotes-closing=\"47.18\" data-quotes-now=\"47.44\" data-link=\"/companies/tyson-foods\" data-name=\"Tyson Foods\"></span>, initiated an all-khaki uniform for his employees. And as Tyson built his company from a small chicken processing plant to the behemoth it is today, he often wore the company uniform with his name, Don, emblazoned on the upper right shoulder.</p>\n<p>For Walmart, the initial advantages of a khaki uniform have vanished. The company began looking for ways to make its employees stand out rather than blend in with customers. Last fall it started asking employees to wear a standard Walmart vest to make them identifiable for shoppers. It was only a matter of time before the chain let its employees leave their khakis at home.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Also on Forbes:</strong></em></p>\n<div class=\"article-gallery-embedded\" data-url=\"http://www.forbes.com/pictures/gklg45eh/walmart-to-go/\"> \n <div class=\"embedded-content clearfix\"> \n  <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/pictures/gklg45eh/walmart-to-go/\" class=\"clearfix\" target=\"_self\"> \n   <div class=\"article-image-box\"> \n    <!--start:main_image--> \n    <img src=\"http://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/c8bac711eff4d33d1a8156f53047b8de/400x400.jpg?fit=scale&amp;background=000000\" alt=\"\" /> \n    <!--end:main_image--> \n   </div> \n   <div class=\"article-text-box\"> \n    <header> \n     <i class=\"icon icon-gallery\"></i>Gallery \n    </header> \n    <h4>Walmart Goes Small</h4> \n    <div class=\"article-launch-gallery\"> \n     <span class=\"article-launch-text\">Launch Gallery</span> \n     <div class=\"article-slide-count\">\n       10 images \n     </div> \n    </div> \n    <button class=\"article-launch-button\"><i class=\"icon icon-chevron-right\"></i></button> \n   </div></a> \n </div> \n</div>"],"galleryId":"54f4e701da47a54de82442dc","disableDigest":false,"writtenByForbesStaff":true,"channelSectionMappings":[{"id":"channel_1","channelName":"Business","url":"/business"},{"id":"channel_1section_59","channelName":"Business","sectionName":"Retail","url":"/retail"},{"id":"channel_6","channelName":"Leadership","url":"/leadership"}],"brandVoiceTitle":"Trouser Trouble: Why Walmart Had To Give Up Khaki Pants","groupAuthor":{"naturalId":"blogAuthorId/blog/author/blog-3783","name":"Laura Reston","avatars":[{"size":0},{"size":0},{"size":0},{"size":0}],"url":"http://www.forbes.com/sites/laurareston/","profileUrl":"http://blogs.forbes.com/laurareston/profile/","authorType":"individual","blog":true,"numFollowers":0,"timestamp":1445787839373,"primaryBlogNaturalId":"blogAuthorId/blog/author/blog-3783","primaryContributor":"blogAuthorId/blog/author/1733598","primaryContributorData":{"naturalId":"blogAuthorId/blog/author/1733598","name":"Laura Reston","avatars":[{"size":40,"image":"http://blogs-images.forbes.com/files/2015/06/Laura-Reston_avatar_1433426529-40x40.jpg"},{"size":62,"image":"http://blogs-images.forbes.com/files/2015/06/Laura-Reston_avatar_1433426529-62x62.jpg"},{"size":136,"image":"http://blogs-images.forbes.com/files/2015/06/Laura-Reston_avatar_1433426529-136x136.jpg"},{"size":400,"image":"http://blogs-images.forbes.com/files/2015/06/Laura-Reston_avatar_1433426529-400x400.jpg"}],"blog":false,"numFollowers":0,"shortBio":"I write about leadership in the evolving American workplace.","description":"I work on the leadership channel here at Forbes, writing about careers and leaders in the evolving American workplace.
