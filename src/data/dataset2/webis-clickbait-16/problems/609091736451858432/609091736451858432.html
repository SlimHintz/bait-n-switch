Biotech IPO That Rose By 90% Speaks","date":1434037920000,"timestamp":1434078136721,"body":"<strong>By Matthew Herper and Nathan Vardi</strong>\r\n\r\nThis morning, a company that did not exist last summer had the biggest U.S. biotech IPO ever. Axovant Sciences sold shares at $15 a piece, raising $315 million at a $1.4 billion valuation. Already, the stock is up 90%, giving Axovant a valuation of about $2.8 billion.\r\n\r\nBehind the massive IPO is a 29-year-old former hedge fund manager, Vivek Ramaswamy, who previously worked as a partner at Dan Gold&rsquo;s QVT. In that capacity, we put him on the Forbes 30 Under 30 in Finance list. He left the hedge fund firm last year and founded Roivant, in which QVT is an investor. Axovant was formed in October and spun off by Roivant.\r\n\r\nIn December 2014, Ramaswamy engineered the purchase of an experimental Alzheimer&rsquo;s pill from GlaxoSmithKline for $5 million. It is Axovant&rsquo;s sole asset. GlaxoSmithKline also obtained a 12.5% royalty based on net sales and Axovant is obligated to pay the drug giant tens of millions of dollars more if certain milestones are achieved.\r\n\r\nFORBES spoke to Ramaswamy this morning in his first interview since the IPO. Below are edited versions of his answers.\r\n\r\n<img class=\" size-full wp-image-15460\" src=\"http://blogs-images.forbes.com/nathanvardi/files/2015/06/vivek-ramaswamy.jpg\" alt=\"vivek-ramaswamy\">\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>How is a drug he bought for $5 million suddenly worth $2 billion?</strong>\r\n\r\n&ldquo;We think we have a great drug candidate,&rdquo; says Ramaswamy. &ldquo;If this drug is approved we think it&rsquo;s going to make a huge difference for a lot of patients and ultimately there is a huge need and a great team here to do it.&rdquo;\r\n\r\nRVT-101 is taken once-daily, doesn&rsquo;t seem to cause onerous side effects, and has been evaluated in 13 clinical trials. In a 684-patient randomized, controlled clinical trial on top of an existing Alzheimer&rsquo;s drug, it benefited both cognition and, more impressively, patients&rsquo; ability to function at 24 weeks. Ramaswamy says that can&rsquo;t be said for a competing drug being developed by Lundbeck.\r\n<!--nextpage-->\r\n<strong>Ramaswamy argues that his team is the best in the business.</strong>\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Our team includes several of the leading drug developers in Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease and is as well suited as can be,&rdquo; he said. On that team: Lawrence Friedhoff, who helped develop Aricept, the most widely used medication to treat Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease; Lawrence Olanoff, the developer of the second-most widely used drug to treat Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease, Namenda; and Atul Pande, the former head of the neurosciences unit of GlaxoSmithKline that led the development of RVT-101.\r\n\r\n<strong>Is Ramaswamy doing favors for his hedge fund friends?</strong>\r\n\r\nThe Axovant IPO comes at a time when biotech stocks have been in favor with investors in general and hedge funds in particular. It seems like a big win for two hedge funds, RA Capital and Visium Asset Management, who participated in the IPO, but Ramaswamy swatted away the notion that he is playing a clubby hedge fund game, pointing out the RA Capital and Visium are new investors to Axovant.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;There were two funds that indicated an interest in our S-1 registration statement to purchase about $150 million of shares at the offering price,&rdquo; Ramaswamy said. &ldquo;They are new investors which agreed to a 90 day lock-up, which is a restriction above and beyond other market participants.&rdquo;\r\n\r\nRamaswamy is bringing his family along for the ride. His mother and brother are both employees of Axovant Sciences and have received some 1 million stock options between them that carry an exercise price of 90 cents per share. &ldquo;They are both physicians by training, one of them has been a geriatric physiatrist who has treated patients with Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease for a couple of decades,&rdquo; says Ramaswamy. &ldquo;Like all of our employees they have received stock options.&rdquo;","description":"Vivek Ramaswamy is the man behind Axovant Sciences, which conducted its IPO on Thursday and saw its stock soar, giving it a valuation of $2.5 billion.

Axovant Sciences sold shares at $15 a piece, raising $315 million at a $1.4 billion valuation. Already, the stock is up 90%, giving Axovant a valuation of about $2.8 billion.</p>\n<p>Behind the massive IPO is a 29-year-old former hedge fund manager, Vivek Ramaswamy, who previously worked as a partner at Dan Gold’s QVT. In that capacity, we put him on the Forbes 30 Under 30 in Finance list. He left the hedge fund firm last year and founded Roivant, in which QVT is an investor. Axovant was formed in October and spun off by Roivant.</p>\n<p>In December 2014, Ramaswamy engineered the purchase of an experimental Alzheimer’s pill from GlaxoSmithKline for $5 million. It is Axovant’s sole asset. GlaxoSmithKline also obtained a 12.5% royalty based on net sales and Axovant is obligated to pay the drug giant tens of millions of dollars more if certain milestones are achieved.</p>\n<div id=\"inread\" article-ad-inbody=\"inread\" class=\"inread\"></div>\n<p>FORBES spoke to Ramaswamy this morning in his first interview since the IPO. Below are edited versions of his answers.</p>\n<p><img class=\" size-full wp-image-15460\" src=\"http://blogs-images.forbes.com/nathanvardi/files/2015/06/vivek-ramaswamy.jpg\" alt=\"vivek-ramaswamy\" /></p>\n<p><strong>How is a drug he bought for $5 million suddenly worth $2 billion?</strong></p>\n<div class=\"vestpocket\" vest-pocket=\"\"></div>\n<p>“We think we have a great drug candidate,” says Ramaswamy. “If this drug is approved we think it’s going to make a huge difference for a lot of patients and ultimately there is a huge need and a great team here to do it.”</p>\n<p>RVT-101 is taken once-daily, doesn’t seem to cause onerous side effects, and has been evaluated in 13 clinical trials. In a 684-patient randomized, controlled clinical trial on top of an existing Alzheimer’s drug, it benefited both cognition and, more impressively, patients’ ability to function at 24 weeks. Ramaswamy says that can’t be said for a competing drug being developed by Lundbeck.</p>","<p><strong>Ramaswamy argues that his team is the best in the business.</strong></p>\n<p>“Our team includes several of the leading drug developers in Alzheimer’s disease and is as well suited as can be,” he said. On that team: Lawrence Friedhoff, who helped develop Aricept, the most widely used medication to treat Alzheimer’s disease; Lawrence Olanoff, the developer of the second-most widely used drug to treat Alzheimer’s disease, Namenda; and Atul Pande, the former head of the neurosciences unit of GlaxoSmithKline that led the development of RVT-101.</p>\n<p><strong>Is Ramaswamy doing favors for his hedge fund friends?</strong></p>\n<p>The Axovant IPO comes at a time when biotech stocks have been in favor with investors in general and hedge funds in particular. It seems like a big win for two hedge funds, RA Capital and Visium Asset Management, who participated in the IPO, but Ramaswamy swatted away the notion that he is playing a clubby hedge fund game, pointing out the RA Capital and Visium are new investors to Axovant.</p>\n<p>“There were two funds that indicated an interest in our S-1 registration statement to purchase about $150 million of shares at the offering price,” Ramaswamy said. “They are new investors which agreed to a 90 day lock-up, which is a restriction above and beyond other market participants.”</p>\n<div id=\"inread\" article-ad-inbody=\"inread\" class=\"inread\"></div>\n<p>Ramaswamy is bringing his family along for the ride. His mother and brother are both employees of Axovant Sciences and have received some 1 million stock options between them that carry an exercise price of 90 cents per share. “They are both physicians by training, one of them has been a geriatric physiatrist who has treated patients with Alzheimer’s disease for a couple of decades,” says Ramaswamy. “Like all of our employees they have received stock options.”</p>"],"disableDigest":false,"writtenByForbesStaff":true,"channelSectionMappings":[{"id":"channel_2","channelName":"Investing","url":"/investing"}],"brandVoiceTitle":"The 29 Year Old Behind The Giant Biotech IPO That Rose By 90% Speaks","digestDisabled":false,"individualAuthor":{"naturalId":"blogAuthorId/blog/author/67","name":"Nathan Vardi","avatars":[{"size":40,"image":"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/b6bfeb565e3621d0b341914188789a13?s=40&amp;d=http%3A%2F%2F1.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2Fad516503a11cd5ca435acc9bb6523536%3Fs%3D40&amp;r=G"},{"size":62,"image":"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/b6bfeb565e3621d0b341914188789a13?s=62&amp;d=http%3A%2F%2F1.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2Fad516503a11cd5ca435acc9bb6523536%3Fs%3D62&amp;r=G"},{"size":136,"image":"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/b6bfeb565e3621d0b341914188789a13?s=136&amp;d=http%3A%2F%2F1.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2Fad516503a11cd5ca435acc9bb6523536%3Fs%3D136&amp;r=G"},{"size":400,"image":"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/b6bfeb565e3621d0b341914188789a13?s=400&amp;d=http%3A%2F%2F1.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2Fad516503a11cd5ca435acc9bb6523536%3Fs%3D400&amp;r=G"}],"url":"http://www.forbes.com/sites/nathanvardi/","type":"Forbes Staff","profileUrl":"/sites/nathanvardi/","twitterName":"nathanvardi","authorType":"individual","email":"nvardi@forbes.com","blog":false,"numFollowers":0,"shortBio":"Following the money trail","timestamp":1445787595594,"description":"I spend most of my time digging into Wall Street, hedge funds and private equity firms, looking for both the good and the bad.
