The first story can be found here.\nDUHOK, Iraq \u2014 The smuggler scrolled through text messages on his phone that showed photos of people for sale. \nThere was a 15-year-old girl with a $10,000 price tag. A mother and her two daughters priced at $20,500. There was also a picture of a small, smiling boy among the many photos which, the smuggler said, came from ISIS militants or people inside ISIS territory, willing to get the captives out \u2014 for a price. \n\"They keep raising their prices,\" the smuggler said. \"They know that people would do anything, pay anything, to get their family back.\"\nSee also: A life after slavery: how one woman escaped ISIS\n\nA smuggler shows images of Yazidis held captive by ISISImage:  Emily FeldmanWhen the radicals made their big push into Iraq last summer, they targeted Yazidis with particular cruelty. ISIS views the ancient religious minority as infidels \u2014 fair game for forced conversion, slavery and execution. During the ISIS onslaught, thousands were killed or carted off to ISIS-territory where they were sold off as slaves. \nOfficials in Iraq\u2019s Kurdish region, where most survivors wound up, have tallied roughly that as many as 1,200 were killed, 840 are still missing and 4,500 were taken as slaves. Other local activists also tracking the crisis have come up with similar numbers. \n\nThe United Nations, which has conducted a separate investigation, meanwhile notes that it is difficult to come up with precise figures since many of those who are listed as missing may actually been killed.\n\nAn identification card lies in the dirt in northern Iraq near what is believed to be graves dug after ISIS overran the area, Dec. 22, 2014.Image: Dalton Bennett/Associated PressWhat is undisputed, however, is the brutality that Yazidis have faced while in ISIS captivity \u2014 particularly women who have been treated as spoils of war. Those who have managed to escape describe systematic sexual brutality against women of all ages and even little girls.\nWith limited help from local military forces who are stretched thin fighting the expansionist forces of ISIS, rescue missions have largely fallen to the Yazidi community itself, with financial and logistical backing from the Kurdish Regional Government (KRG). \n\nYazidi refugees in their accomodation in a refugee camp in Erbil, Iraq, 20 February.Image: EPA/ROBERT JAEGERThe Office of Yazidi Affairs has been tasked by the KRG to help tally and rescue the thousands of men, women and children still held in slavery. Its director, Hussein Koro, says that some 1,700 Yazidis had been rescued or managed to escape but that ISIS is still holding as many as 3,000 people captive.\nTo rescue those in captivity, Koro's office relies on people with contacts inside ISIS-held territory. Officials admit they pay smugglers to get the women out but insist they don't pay money directly to the radicals.\nHowever, two people involved in rescue operations said everything goes when it comes to getting people out. \n\u201cWe do it every way we can,\u201d said one man who claims to have rescued some 400 people since August. \"If it was your daughter, you\u2019d do anything.\" The Yazidi man, whose identity is being withheld to protect him, said that sometimes he is able to rescue women by pretending to be a member of ISIS interested in buying new slaves. \n\nWhile ISIS separated most women and girls from the rest of their families, Hadia Shamo and her 7-year-old daughter managed to evade detection, by hiding among elderly women. They spent their months in captivity with their other family members who were forced to do farm work.Image: Emily Feldman His ISIS contacts test him on his knowledge of Islam and only when he passes this test does the market open, he said. Unlike Western hostages who have been kidnapped for ransom, the smuggler says ISIS wants to keep the Yazidis. \"The women are only for ISIS fighters. A non-ISIS member cannot buy one,\" he said.\nRescue operations, however, are a dangerous business that puts everyone's lives at risk.\nThe smuggler says he, his wife and their four children have moved every two months since he got into the business of getting people out, and that he's sure there's a target on his back.\n\"I\u2019m very worried about safety,\" he said. He recently went to the U.S. Consulate in Erbil in the hopes of making a case for asylum in person. But the line for Yazidis trying to leave Iraq is long and he returned to Duhok feeling dejected. \n\nIn this Sunday Jan. 11, 2015 photo, an elderly Yazidi fighter poses in front of the Sharaf al-Deen temple shrineImage: Seivan Selim/Associated PressMeanwhile, he has become known as the go-to person to call for help. He was the first person Said Ali called when he got access to a phone in captivity. The 45-year-old builder from Kocho, a village in the Sinjar region of Iraq, was kidnapped with his wife, eight children and his brother\u2019s family in August. When ISIS confiscated the captives\u2019 phones, Ali slipped his SIM cards out and hid them. \nFor months, he and his relatives were forced to tend sheep. It wasn\u2019t until his wife became ill and he requested permission to bring her to a hospital in Mosul that he first got an opportunity to use a phone. An ISIS fighter guarded them as they went to the hospital but, to Ali's surprise, allowed him to buy a cheap phone. As soon as he returned home, Ali dug up one of the hidden SIM cards and called up the smuggler, whom he had known since childhood. \nHe laid out everything: his location, what security was like, and his friend noted everything down, promising to do what he could to free them. Later, he called back with instructions: when and where the family should go and who would escort them through the hostile territory.\n\nBerhim Haji's family now lives on tents on the side of a road. Image: Emily FeldmanTrekking for days by foot and sleeping in fields, he and his family were finally able to escape the clutches of ISIS and reach safe haven in the Kurdish-held area of northern Iraq. In addition to Ali and his brother\u2019s family, the smugglers had also been able to spirit 16 girls to safety. \nThe smugglers inside ISIS-held territory demanded $2,000 per person to help get them to safety, and those in the KRG said they were working to gather the funds.\nKoro from the Office of Yazidi Affairs said that the government does not always have enough money to cover the costs of rescue operations, leaving individual families to come up with the money even for rescues arranged by officials.\n\nPeople visit the Sharaf al-Deen temple shrine, one of the holiest for the Yazidis, a religious minority in Iraq, Jan. 11, 2015Image: Seivan Selim/Associated PressThat was the case for Berhim Haji, a laborer from a village near Sinjar, who says he and his 25-member family were asked to pay $40,000 for their rescue. The family managed to escape from ISIS three months ago with the help of another high-profile smuggler on the government's payroll.\nEnslaved since August, the older members of the family were forced to do farm work while the teenage boys were indoctrinated, trained to fight and often beaten. Two women from the family were separated from the rest and brought to Syria. They remain in ISIS captivity.\nShortly after the Haji family made it to safety, someone appeared one day, asking for the money to pay the smugglers. Haji had already lost his home, his sister was still being held and his family was severely traumatized after their ISIS captivity and were now living in tents on the side of a road. \n\nBerhim Haji says his 4-year-old son Rian has had nightmares and grown terrified of men with beards since the family was abducted by ISISImage: Emily FeldmanOfficials involved with the rescue would not discuss the cost of the operation or could not be reached. \n\"We're doing our best to rescue as many as we can, but we can\u2019t do it by ourselves,\" said Hussein Koro, from his office in Dohuk. \"We need other countries to help [but] the international community is just watching, sleeping. We are begging them to help. We know how much our women and girls are suffering under ISIS.\"\nThis story was reported with support from The Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting.Have something to add to this story?
