America For A Sport Loved Around The World","date":1434048960000,"timestamp":1434049001901,"body":"<em>By Donna Bryson</em>\r\n\r\nWhen USA Rugby began in 1975, the game it represented was relatively unknown in the U.S. Nearly 40 years later, rugby has a loyal American following, with 115,000 active members on more than 3,000 teams across the country. Rugby itself has also experienced explosive growth in the U.S.&mdash;participation in the sport increased by 350 percent between 2004 and 2011.<sup>1</sup>\r\n\r\nBringing rugby into the American spotlight is now the job of Nigel Melville, USA Rugby&rsquo;s executive director. But getting Americans excited about rugby couldn&rsquo;t be done without funding and support. Melville noted that local Boulder-area bankers from Chase have recognized the value in growing rugby's domestic appeal and regularly offer the financial support necessary to expand the sport&rsquo;s popularity.\r\n<blockquote><span>They know that if we grow the game and increase our media and broadcast presence, we will attract more fans, sponsors, and more revenues to continue developing the game.</span>\r\n\r\n<em>Nigel Melville, USA Rugby Executive Director</em></blockquote>\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_205\" align=\"\" width=\"724\"]<img class=\"size-full wp-image-205\" src=\"http://blogs-images.forbes.com/jpmorganchase/files/2015/05/usa_rugby_img.jpg\" alt=\"Nearly 40 years after USA Rugby opened its doors, the rough-and-tumble sport returns to the Olympic Games in 2016.\"> Nearly 40 years after USA Rugby opened its doors, the rough-and-tumble sport returns to the Olympic Games in 2016.[/caption]\r\n\r\nSupport from Chase has also helped USA Rugby to expand its grant program, enabling state rugby organizations to hire youth development staff. This year, USA Rugby has awarded 10 grants, compared to only three in 2010. The grant program&rsquo;s budget has also increased, growing from $100,000 to $250,000. Then, when the organization experienced financial instability a few years ago, Chase helped by extending its line of credit.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_206\" align=\"\" width=\"724\"]<img class=\"size-full wp-image-206\" src=\"http://blogs-images.forbes.com/jpmorganchase/files/2015/05/usa_rugby_grid.jpg\" alt=\"Thanks in part to funding by Chase, USA Rugby continues to hire staff and generate enthusiasm about the sport.\"> Thanks in part to funding by Chase, USA Rugby continues to hire staff and generate enthusiasm about the sport.[/caption]\r\n\r\nChase Market Manager Joe C. notes: &ldquo;We understand that helping rugby grow means standing with the organization during both good and lean times. That&rsquo;s what it means to be part of this sport&rsquo;s community.&rdquo;\r\n\r\nBut the company&rsquo;s support for rugby isn&rsquo;t just limited to financial services. Senior executives often serve as league coaches in programs coordinated by USA Rugby. The bank has also sponsored premiership rugby in England, and J.P. Morgan club teams have long competed in financial sector rugby tournaments in England and Hong Kong.\r\n\nMelville acknowledges that the game isn&rsquo;t as familiar to most Americans as it is to its fans at JPMorgan Chase. But he expects the exposure it will get as an Olympic sport will raise awareness among Americans, whose women&rsquo;s national team is among the top five in the world.\r\n\r\nThrough careful planning and a commitment to growth, USA Rugby is poised to bring rugby back to the forefront of the American sports world. With help from thousands of loyal fans&mdash;including those at JPMorgan Chase&mdash;and their participation in the 2015 Rugby World Cup and the 2016 Olympics, rugby may just be the next big thing in American sports.\r\n\r\nFor more information about USA Rugby visit:&nbsp;<a href=\"http://usarugby.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\" >usarugby.org</a> or learn about <a href=\"http://www.jpmorganchase.com/corporate/Corporate-Responsibility/city-partnership-denver.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\" >Denver &amp; JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co</a>.\r\n\r\n1.&nbsp;<a title=\"ECONOMIC IMPACT REPORT ON GLOBAL RUGBY\" href=\"http://www.irb.com/mm/Document/NewsMedia/MediaZone/02/04/22/88/2042288_PDF.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" >http://www.irb.com/mm/Document/NewsMedia/MediaZone/02/04/22/88/2042288_PDF.pdf</a>\r\n\r\n<em>After living abroad for 19 years, Donna returned to the US and is settled in Denver.

Donna Bryson</em></p>\n<p>When USA Rugby began in 1975, the game it represented was relatively unknown in the U.S. Nearly 40 years later, rugby has a loyal American following, with 115,000 active members on more than 3,000 teams across the country. Rugby itself has also experienced explosive growth in the U.S.—participation in the sport increased by 350 percent between 2004 and 2011.<sup>1</sup></p>\n<p>Bringing rugby into the American spotlight is now the job of Nigel Melville, USA Rugby’s executive director. But getting Americans excited about rugby couldn’t be done without funding and support. Melville noted that local Boulder-area bankers from Chase have recognized the value in growing rugby’s domestic appeal and regularly offer the financial support necessary to expand the sport’s popularity.</p>\n<blockquote> \n <p><span>They know that if we grow the game and increase our media and broadcast presence, we will attract more fans, sponsors, and more revenues to continue developing the game.</span></p> \n <p><em>Nigel Melville, USA Rugby Executive Director</em></p> \n</blockquote>\n<div id=\"attachment_205\"> \n <img class=\"size-full wp-image-205\" src=\"http://blogs-images.forbes.com/jpmorganchase/files/2015/05/usa_rugby_img.jpg\" alt=\"Nearly 40 years after USA Rugby opened its doors, the rough-and-tumble sport returns to the Olympic Games in 2016.\" /> \n <p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Nearly 40 years after USA Rugby opened its doors, the rough-and-tumble sport returns to the Olympic Games in 2016.</p> \n</div>\n<p>Support from Chase has also helped USA Rugby to expand its grant program, enabling state rugby organizations to hire youth development staff. This year, USA Rugby has awarded 10 grants, compared to only three in 2010. The grant program’s budget has also increased, growing from $100,000 to $250,000. Then, when the organization experienced financial instability a few years ago, Chase helped by extending its line of credit.</p>\n<div class=\"vestpocket\" vest-pocket=\"\"></div>\n<div id=\"attachment_206\"> \n <img class=\"size-full wp-image-206\" src=\"http://blogs-images.forbes.com/jpmorganchase/files/2015/05/usa_rugby_grid.jpg\" alt=\"Thanks in part to funding by Chase, USA Rugby continues to hire staff and generate enthusiasm about the sport.\" /> \n <p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Thanks in part to funding by Chase, USA Rugby continues to hire staff and generate enthusiasm about the sport.</p> \n</div>\n<p>Chase Market Manager Joe C. notes: “We understand that helping rugby grow means standing with the organization during both good and lean times. That’s what it means to be part of this sport’s community.”</p>\n<p>But the company’s support for rugby isn’t just limited to financial services. Senior executives often serve as league coaches in programs coordinated by USA Rugby. The bank has also sponsored premiership rugby in England, and J.P. Morgan club teams have long competed in financial sector rugby tournaments in England and Hong Kong.</p>\n<p>Melville acknowledges that the game isn’t as familiar to most Americans as it is to its fans at JPMorgan Chase. But he expects the exposure it will get as an Olympic sport will raise awareness among Americans, whose women’s national team is among the top five in the world.</p>\n<p>Through careful planning and a commitment to growth, USA Rugby is poised to bring rugby back to the forefront of the American sports world. With help from thousands of loyal fans—including those at JPMorgan Chase—and their participation in the 2015 Rugby World Cup and the 2016 Olympics, rugby may just be the next big thing in American sports.</p>\n<p>For more information about USA Rugby visit:&nbsp;<a href=\"http://usarugby.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">usarugby.org</a> or learn about <a href=\"http://www.jpmorganchase.com/corporate/Corporate-Responsibility/city-partnership-denver.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Denver &amp; JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co</a>.</p>\n<p>1.&nbsp;<a title=\"ECONOMIC IMPACT REPORT ON GLOBAL RUGBY\" href=\"http://www.irb.com/mm/Document/NewsMedia/MediaZone/02/04/22/88/2042288_PDF.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.irb.com/mm/Document/NewsMedia/MediaZone/02/04/22/88/2042288_PDF.pdf</a></p>\n<p><em>After living abroad for 19 years, Donna returned to the US and is settled in Denver.
