Now Basically The Biggest Action Movie Ever","date":1433948400000,"timestamp":1433948760932,"body":"<p>As of today,&nbsp;<em>Furious 7&nbsp;</em>has topped the $350.9 million domestic total of&nbsp;<em>American Sniper</em>. It had $350.81m as of Monday so it will likely surpass the Clint Eastwood action drama's $350.9m today if it didn't on Tuesday. Without taking anything away from the Bradley Cooper Oscar nominated film,&nbsp;<em>Furious 7&nbsp;</em>is now basically the biggest straight action movie of all time. By \"straight\" action movie, I mean an action picture that isn't rooted in fantasy or costumed heroics. And in that sense, the seventh Vin Diesel/Paul Walker adventure is indeed the biggest-grossing such title in American box office history, not accounting for inflation.\r\n\r\nBut what about inflation? &nbsp;Well, here's the kicker. Even when you add in the whole \"tickets were cheaper when I had to walk uphill both ways in six feet of snow to get to my one screen shoebox theater inside a dilapidated mall\" factor,&nbsp;<em>Furious 7&nbsp;</em>still very nearly comes out on top with but a few random exceptions. With the obvious caveat that Hollywood makes a lot fewer \"set on Earth with no superpowers\" action films than they used to in the 1970's, 1980's, and 1990's, James Wan's sequel is still pretty much bigger than the biggest installment of almost any action franchise you can name.\r\n\r\nIn terms of real world action movies and their adjusted gross totals, <em>Furious 7&nbsp;</em>trails only the $538 million-grossing&nbsp;<em>Goldfinger&nbsp;</em>($51 million in 1964) and the $607 million-grossing&nbsp;<em>Thunderball</em>&nbsp;($65 million in 1965) in terms of adjusted-for-inflation grosses. Among kinda-sorta action movies, it does trail <em>Top Gun&nbsp;</em>($389m/$176m ), <em>Saving Private Ryan&nbsp;</em>($371m/$216m), and <em>The Fugitive&nbsp;</em>($360m/$183m). But it has already sold more tickets than the likes of <em>Mission: Impossible II</em>&nbsp;($324 million adjusted gross/$215 million actual gross), the first&nbsp;<em>Mission: Impossible</em>&nbsp;($332m/$181m), and <em>Rambo: First Blood Part II</em>&nbsp;($344m/$150m). Yes, it's well above&nbsp;<em>The French Connection&nbsp;</em>as well and even 1938's&nbsp;<em>The Adventures of Robin Hood&nbsp;</em>(<em>Furious 7&nbsp;</em>would have earned $9.9m in 1938, compared to the Errol Flynn film's $3.8m gross).\r\n\r\nIf you factor in pretty much every remotely recent non-fantastical/non-superhero action franchise, even the action comedy, it still ends up with more tickets sold than all but&nbsp;<em>Beverly Hills Cop</em>&nbsp;($545m/$234m). It has even outperformed the likes of &nbsp;<em>Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me</em>&nbsp;($329m/$205m), and&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Rush Hour 2</em> ($324m/$226m), and&nbsp;<em>Beverly Hills Cop II&nbsp;</em>($319m/$153m). &nbsp;Unless you add magic spells or capes, there just isn't much out there in the recent past or even the much-less-recent past to compare to the $350.4m and counting total of Universal/Comcast Corp.'s seventh&nbsp;<em>Fast/Furious&nbsp;</em>movie. It has sold more tickets than every&nbsp;<em>Die Hard</em>&nbsp;film and every&nbsp;<em>Lethal Weapon</em>&nbsp;film. &nbsp;Even in terms of sci-fi centric action pictures, it has outgrossed two out of the three&nbsp;Matrix&nbsp;movies (<em>Matrix Reloaded</em>&nbsp;has a $379 million adjusted gross from a $281m 2003 total) and all but the second <em>Terminator&nbsp;</em>movie ($395m/$203m).\r\n\r\nIt has outgrossed the adjusted-for-inflation totals of all but&nbsp;the top 12 comic book adaptations thus far released. &nbsp;What this arguably shows is how&nbsp;dominant <em>Furious 7&nbsp;</em>was in terms of the real-world action picture. &nbsp;But of course, it also shows how heavily the top-grossing films are dominated by fantasy-laden action pictures as opposed to the more 'real people in real cities with real guns' variation that were once considered the \"A\" pictures (it gets pantsed by the likes of&nbsp;Indiana Jones, <em>The Hunger Games</em>,&nbsp;and&nbsp;Harry Potter) before the double whammy of comic book adventures and fantasy epics took their hold on the global box office. But that's a conversation for another day.\r\n\r\nThe fact remains that&nbsp;<em>Furious 7&nbsp;</em>is the biggest real-world action movie in American box office history and still one of the very biggest when you account for inflation. I don't have any grand nuggets of wisdom to take from all of this. I ran these numbers back when <em>Skyfall&nbsp;</em>topped $300 million domestic in January 2013 and I wanted to check back in and see what had changed. But once again, as we see whether or not&nbsp;<em>Furious 7&nbsp;</em>can overtake&nbsp;<em>The Avengers&nbsp;</em>worldwide (it's about $8 million away) and whether or not&nbsp;<em>Avengers: Age of Ultron&nbsp;</em>can overtake it when it opens in Japan next month, it's worth pointing out that Universal only gets to bask in these riches because they went ahead of greenlight the first&nbsp;<em>The Fast &amp; the Furious&nbsp;</em>when it was an original property with an ethnically diverse cast back in 2001.\r\n</p><div>They only get to bask in this fortune and glory because they didn't give up on the franchise when it threaten to drift itself straight to DVD in the mid-2000's and/or get a now-fashionable reboot. Sequels and remakes are well-and-good. Heck, we're celebrating the box office triumph of a part 7 in a long-running franchise and its surpassing an action drama that was not a sequel or even based on anything save a real-life memoir. But you can't get to part seven without rolling the dice on part one. This is the part when I end this with some pun or reference to living one's life a quarter mile at a time, but I got nothing.</div>","description":"As of today, Furious 7 has topped the $350.9 million domestic total of American Sniper.

Entertainment","url":"/media-entertainment"},"pages":["<p>As of today,&nbsp;<em>Furious 7&nbsp;</em>has topped the $350.9 million domestic total of&nbsp;<em>American Sniper</em>. It had $350.81m as of Monday so it will likely surpass the Clint Eastwood action drama’s $350.9m today if it didn’t on Tuesday. Without taking anything away from the Bradley Cooper Oscar nominated film,&nbsp;<em>Furious 7&nbsp;</em>is now basically the biggest straight action movie of all time. By “straight” action movie, I mean an action picture that isn’t rooted in fantasy or costumed heroics. And in that sense, the seventh Vin Diesel/Paul Walker adventure is indeed the biggest-grossing such title in American box office history, not accounting for inflation.</p>\n<p>But what about inflation? &nbsp;Well, here’s the kicker. Even when you add in the whole “tickets were cheaper when I had to walk uphill both ways in six feet of snow to get to my one screen shoebox theater inside a dilapidated mall” factor,&nbsp;<em>Furious 7&nbsp;</em>still very nearly comes out on top with but a few random exceptions. With the obvious caveat that Hollywood makes a lot fewer “set on Earth with no superpowers” action films than they used to in the 1970′s, 1980′s, and 1990′s, James Wan’s sequel is still pretty much bigger than the biggest installment of almost any action franchise you can name.</p>\n<p>In terms of real world action movies and their adjusted gross totals, <em>Furious 7&nbsp;</em>trails only the $538 million-grossing&nbsp;<em>Goldfinger&nbsp;</em>($51 million in 1964) and the $607 million-grossing&nbsp;<em>Thunderball</em>&nbsp;($65 million in 1965) in terms of adjusted-for-inflation grosses. Among kinda-sorta action movies, it does trail <em>Top Gun&nbsp;</em>($389m/$176m ), <em>Saving Private Ryan&nbsp;</em>($371m/$216m), and <em>The Fugitive&nbsp;</em>($360m/$183m). But it has already sold more tickets than the likes of <em>Mission: Impossible II</em>&nbsp;($324 million adjusted gross/$215 million actual gross), the first&nbsp;<em>Mission: Impossible</em>&nbsp;($332m/$181m), and <em>Rambo: First Blood Part II</em>&nbsp;($344m/$150m). Yes, it’s well above&nbsp;<em>The French Connection&nbsp;</em>as well and even 1938′s&nbsp;<em>The Adventures of Robin Hood&nbsp;</em>(<em>Furious 7&nbsp;</em>would have earned $9.9m in 1938, compared to the Errol Flynn film’s $3.8m gross).</p>\n<p>If you factor in pretty much every remotely recent non-fantastical/non-superhero action franchise, even the action comedy, it still ends up with more tickets sold than all but&nbsp;<em>Beverly Hills Cop</em>&nbsp;($545m/$234m). It has even outperformed the likes of &nbsp;<em>Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me</em>&nbsp;($329m/$205m), and&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Rush Hour 2</em> ($324m/$226m), and&nbsp;<em>Beverly Hills Cop II&nbsp;</em>($319m/$153m). &nbsp;Unless you add magic spells or capes, there just isn’t much out there in the recent past or even the much-less-recent past to compare to the $350.4m and counting total of Universal/Comcast Corp.’s seventh&nbsp;<em>Fast/Furious&nbsp;</em>movie. It has sold more tickets than every&nbsp;<em>Die Hard</em>&nbsp;film and every&nbsp;<em>Lethal Weapon</em>&nbsp;film. &nbsp;Even in terms of sci-fi centric action pictures, it has outgrossed two out of the three&nbsp;Matrix&nbsp;movies (<em>Matrix Reloaded</em>&nbsp;has a $379 million adjusted gross from a $281m 2003 total) and all but the second <em>Terminator&nbsp;</em>movie ($395m/$203m).</p>\n<div id=\"inread\" article-ad-inbody=\"inread\" class=\"inread\"></div>\n<p>It has outgrossed the adjusted-for-inflation totals of all but&nbsp;the top 12 comic book adaptations thus far released. &nbsp;What this arguably shows is how&nbsp;dominant <em>Furious 7&nbsp;</em>was in terms of the real-world action picture. &nbsp;But of course, it also shows how heavily the top-grossing films are dominated by fantasy-laden action pictures as opposed to the more ‘real people in real cities with real guns’ variation that were once considered the “A” pictures (it gets pantsed by the likes of&nbsp;Indiana Jones, <em>The Hunger Games</em>,&nbsp;and&nbsp;Harry Potter) before the double whammy of comic book adventures and fantasy epics took their hold on the global box office. But that’s a conversation for another day.</p>\n<p>The fact remains that&nbsp;<em>Furious 7&nbsp;</em>is the biggest real-world action movie in American box office history and still one of the very biggest when you account for inflation. I don’t have any grand nuggets of wisdom to take from all of this. I ran these numbers back when <em>Skyfall&nbsp;</em>topped $300 million domestic in January 2013 and I wanted to check back in and see what had changed. But once again, as we see whether or not&nbsp;<em>Furious 7&nbsp;</em>can overtake&nbsp;<em>The Avengers&nbsp;</em>worldwide (it’s about $8 million away) and whether or not&nbsp;<em>Avengers: Age of Ultron&nbsp;</em>can overtake it when it opens in Japan next month, it’s worth pointing out that Universal only gets to bask in these riches because they went ahead of greenlight the first&nbsp;<em>The Fast &amp; the Furious&nbsp;</em>when it was an original property with an ethnically diverse cast back in 2001.</p>\n<div class=\"vestpocket\" vest-pocket=\"\"></div>\n<div>\n  They only get to bask in this fortune and glory because they didn’t give up on the franchise when it threaten to drift itself straight to DVD in the mid-2000′s and/or get a now-fashionable reboot. Sequels and remakes are well-and-good. Heck, we’re celebrating the box office triumph of a part 7 in a long-running franchise and its surpassing an action drama that was not a sequel or even based on anything save a real-life memoir. But you can’t get to part seven without rolling the dice on part one. This is the part when I end this with some pun or reference to living one’s life a quarter mile at a time, but I got nothing. \n</div>"],"disableDigest":false,"writtenByForbesStaff":false,"channelSectionMappings":[{"id":"channel_1","channelName":"Business","url":"/business"},{"id":"channel_1section_3","channelName":"Business","sectionName":"Media & Entertainment","url":"/media-entertainment"},{"id":"channel_7section_94","channelName":"Lifestyle","sectionName":"Arts & Entertainment","url":"/arts-entertainment"}],"images":{"featured":{"url":"http://blogs-images.forbes.com/scottmendelson/files/2015/06/furious-7.jpg","width":1280,"height":720,"title":"furious-7","caption":"","description":""}},"brandVoiceTitle":"Box Office: 'Furious 7' Is Now Basically The Biggest Action Movie Ever","groupAuthor":{"naturalId":"blogAuthorId/blog/author/blog-2595","name":"The Ticket Booth","avatars":[{"size":0},{"size":0},{"size":0},{"size":0}],"url":"http://www.forbes.com/sites/scottmendelson/","profileUrl":"http://blogs.forbes.com/scottmendelson/profile/","authorType":"individual","blog":true,"numFollowers":0,"timestamp":1445791381908,"specialSlot":"tiffany-mult-15","primaryBlogNaturalId":"blogAuthorId/blog/author/blog-2595","primaryContributor":"blogAuthorId/blog/author/291525","primaryContributorData":{"naturalId":"blogAuthorId/blog/author/291525","name":"Scott Mendelson","avatars":[{"size":40,"image":"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/5e0887272964be6b258946209a00ffa2?s=40&amp;d=http%3A%2F%2F1.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2Fad516503a11cd5ca435acc9bb6523536%3Fs%3D40&amp;r=G"},{"size":62,"image":"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/5e0887272964be6b258946209a00ffa2?s=62&amp;d=http%3A%2F%2F1.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2Fad516503a11cd5ca435acc9bb6523536%3Fs%3D62&amp;r=G"},{"size":136,"image":"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/5e0887272964be6b258946209a00ffa2?s=136&amp;d=http%3A%2F%2F1.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2Fad516503a11cd5ca435acc9bb6523536%3Fs%3D136&amp;r=G"},{"size":400,"image":"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/5e0887272964be6b258946209a00ffa2?s=400&amp;d=http%3A%2F%2F1.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2Fad516503a11cd5ca435acc9bb6523536%3Fs%3D400&amp;r=G"}],"blog":false,"numFollowers":0,"shortBio":"I cover the film industry.","description":"I've studied the film industry, both academically and informally, and with an emphasis in box office analysis, for 28 years.
