Invade America, It's The Other Way Around","date":1433880360000,"timestamp":1433949523959,"body":"<p>Chinese online retail billionaire <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/profile/jack-ma/\">Jack Ma</a> has been all over the U.S. business press in the last couple of days, kicking off a <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-06-08/alibaba-s-jack-ma-visiting-u-s-to-lure-businesses-into-china\">transcon journey to shake hands with small-biz America</a> and penning <a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/americas-online-sales-opportunity-in-china-1433804818\">an op-ed today in the Wall Street Journal</a> about how Alibaba's expansion plans do not include an invasion of the U.S. market. Rather, the executive chairman of Alibaba wants U.S. businesses to use Alibaba, already the world's busiest platform for buyers and sellers online, to sell into China.\r\n\r\nHe's a stellar pitchman. In remarks today at the Economic Club of New York, Ma started off by asking the crowd of around 300 to raise their hands if they've ever bought or sold anything on Alibaba. No one&nbsp;raised their hand. He then asked who's been to China. Most hands went up (this was an unrepresentative sample of Americans,<a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-2329298/More-half-Americans-NEVER-traveled-outside-country--passport.html\"> a third of&nbsp;whom lack a passport</a>). There's a huge gap between BABA and what people know about BABA, even though Alibaba <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/ryanmac/2014/09/22/alibaba-claims-title-for-largest-global-ipo-ever-with-extra-share-sales/\">pulled off the largest global&nbsp;IPO in history</a>&nbsp;and sells <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/walterloeb/2013/07/24/alibaba-a-threat-to-amazon-ebay-walmart-and-everyone-else/\">more goods by gross value than Amazon and eBay combined</a>.\r\n\r\nMa laid out the big vision for Alibaba: $1 trillion in gross merchandise value on a global, single, transparent place for anyone to sell anything to anyone in China (and, eventually elsewhere, but mostly in China). &nbsp;\"In America, e-commerce is commerce. In China, it's a lifestyle,\" said Ma. \"More than 500 million people will be middle class in China in five years. And they will want good products and services, many of which they can't get now... China must learn how to buy not just import.\"\r\n\r\nMa&nbsp;clarified what makes Alibaba different from Amazon and eBay, which is its \"asset-light\" strategy (to borrow an unfortunately coined Enron term). It has one billion items for sale, 10 million sellers, 350 million buyers and arranges for 30 million shipments a day but, says Ma, \"we don't buy or sell anything. We don't own warehouses. We manage them for other people. We don't ship anything, leaving that up to partners.\" Ma calls it \"playing ping-pong\" compared with the game of basketball played by the U.S. majors Amazon and eBay.\r\n\r\nDuring question time, NYSE President Tom Farley&nbsp;asked Ma whether he's made too much money from Alibaba---gosh, as if that were even possible! Ma is worth $25 billion according to Forbes' <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/billionaires/#version:realtime\">Real-Time Billionaires list</a>. He answered quickly: \"I haven't had time to spend the money.\" And then he got philosophical about wealth. \"When you have less than $1 million you can be the happiest person in the world. It's when you have $10 million or more that you start to worry about things like trusts and all that. But when you have $1 billion, it's not your money. It's money entrusted to you by others to do more and better things with it.\"\r\n\r\nMa also took a question about fake goods being sold on Alibaba. Ma admits he gets that one a lot, even though he claims that only one out of every 860,000 items on the site are fakes. it's an existential threat for him, too. Shoppers wouldn't come back if they ended up getting fake stuff (though that's debatable). Ma said he used to get death threats from counterfeiters he has shut down with the help of Chinese police. And domestic Chinese brands, he says, are starting to care more about intellectual property. \"It's a war and we're getting somewhere. With more people's help, we will win.\"</p>","description":"Chinese online retail billionaire Jack Ma has been all over the U.S. business press in the last couple of days, kicking off a transcon journey to shake hands with small-biz America and penning an op-ed today in the Wall Street Journal about how Alibaba's expansion plans do not include an [...]","image":"http://blogs-images.forbes.com/bruceupbin/files/2015/06/jack-ma-alibaba-ipo-floor-e1411140671454-1940x1091-300x169.jpg","type":"blog","storyType":"post","uri":"http://www.forbes.com/sites/bruceupbin/2015/06/09/jack-ma-says-alibaba-has-no-plans-to-invade-america-its-the-other-way-around/","comments":[],"visible":true,"promotedChannelSections":[{"channel":"channel_2","section":"section_62","title":"Jack Ma: Alibaba Has No Plans To Invade America","description":"Chinese online retail billionaire Jack Ma has been all over the U.S. business press in the last couple of days, kicking off a transcon journey to shake hands with small-biz America and penning an op-ed today in the Wall Street Journal about how Alibaba's expansion plans do not include an [...]","image":"http://blogs-images.forbes.com/bruceupbin/files/2015/06/jack-ma-alibaba-ipo-floor-e1411140671454-1940x1091-300x169.jpg","location":"top"},{"channel":"channel_2","section":"section_64","title":"Jack Ma: Alibaba Has No Plans To Invade America","description":"Chinese online retail billionaire Jack Ma has been all over the U.S. business press in the last couple of days, kicking off a transcon journey to shake hands with small-biz America and penning an op-ed today in the Wall Street Journal about how Alibaba's expansion plans do not include an [...]","image":"http://blogs-images.forbes.com/bruceupbin/files/2015/06/jack-ma-alibaba-ipo-floor-e1411140671454-1940x1091-300x169.jpg","location":"top"}],"blogId":"988","authors":[{"naturalId":"blogAuthorId/blog/author/28","name":"Bruce Upbin","avatars":[{"size":136,"image":"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/5c374c1933dc22ec2183d6a91ec68e09?s=136&amp;d=http%3A%2F%2F1.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2Fad516503a11cd5ca435acc9bb6523536%3Fs%3D136&amp;r=G"},{"size":40,"image":"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/5c374c1933dc22ec2183d6a91ec68e09?s=40&amp;d=http%3A%2F%2F1.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2Fad516503a11cd5ca435acc9bb6523536%3Fs%3D40&amp;r=G"},{"size":400,"image":"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/5c374c1933dc22ec2183d6a91ec68e09?s=400&amp;d=http%3A%2F%2F1.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2Fad516503a11cd5ca435acc9bb6523536%3Fs%3D400&amp;r=G"},{"size":62,"image":"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/5c374c1933dc22ec2183d6a91ec68e09?s=62&amp;d=http%3A%2F%2F1.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2Fad516503a11cd5ca435acc9bb6523536%3Fs%3D62&amp;r=G"}],"url":"http://www.forbes.com/sites/bruceupbin/","type":"Forbes Staff","profileUrl":"/sites/bruceupbin/","twitterName":"bupbin","authorType":"individual","facebookName":"bruceupbin","linkedIn":"http://www.linkedin.com/in/bruceupbin","email":"bupbin@forbes.com","tagName":"News Meets Data","blog":false,"numFollowers":0,"shortBio":"I manage our technology coverage.","amazon":"http://www.amazon.com/Zen-Steve-Jobs-Caleb-Melby/dp/1118295269","webSite":"http://www.forbes.com","timestamp":1445787594502,"description":"I'm a managing editor at Forbes, overseeing our technology coverage online and in print.

online retail billionaire <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/profile/jack-ma/\" target=\"_self\">Jack Ma</a> has been all over the U.S. business press in the last couple of days, kicking off a <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-06-08/alibaba-s-jack-ma-visiting-u-s-to-lure-businesses-into-china\">transcon journey to shake hands with small-biz America</a> and penning <a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/americas-online-sales-opportunity-in-china-1433804818\">an op-ed today in the Wall Street Journal</a> about how Alibaba’s expansion plans do not include an invasion of the U.S. market. Rather, the executive chairman of Alibaba wants U.S. businesses to use Alibaba, already the world’s busiest platform for buyers and sellers online, to sell into China.</p>\n<p>He’s a stellar pitchman. In remarks today at the Economic Club of New York, Ma started off by asking the crowd of around 300 to raise their hands if they’ve ever bought or sold anything on Alibaba. No one&nbsp;raised their hand. He then asked who’s been to China. Most hands went up (this was an unrepresentative sample of Americans,<a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-2329298/More-half-Americans-NEVER-traveled-outside-country--passport.html\"> a third of&nbsp;whom lack a passport</a>). There’s a huge gap between BABA and what people know about BABA, even though Alibaba <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/ryanmac/2014/09/22/alibaba-claims-title-for-largest-global-ipo-ever-with-extra-share-sales/\" target=\"_self\">pulled off the largest global&nbsp;IPO in history</a>&nbsp;and sells <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/walterloeb/2013/07/24/alibaba-a-threat-to-amazon-ebay-walmart-and-everyone-else/\" target=\"_self\">more goods by gross value than Amazon and eBay combined</a>.</p>\n<p>Ma laid out the big vision for Alibaba: $1 trillion in gross merchandise value on a global, single, transparent place for anyone to sell anything to anyone in China (and, eventually elsewhere, but mostly in China). &nbsp;”In America, e-commerce is commerce. In China, it’s a lifestyle,” said Ma. “More than 500 million people will be middle class in China in five years. And they will want good products and services, many of which they can’t get now… China must learn how to buy not just import.”</p>\n<p>Ma&nbsp;clarified what makes Alibaba different from Amazon and eBay, which is its “asset-light” strategy (to borrow an unfortunately coined Enron term). It has one billion items for sale, 10 million sellers, 350 million buyers and arranges for 30 million shipments a day but, says Ma, “we don’t buy or sell anything. We don’t own warehouses. We manage them for other people. We don’t ship anything, leaving that up to partners.” Ma calls it “playing ping-pong” compared with the game of basketball played by the U.S. majors Amazon and eBay.</p>\n<div id=\"inread\" article-ad-inbody=\"inread\" class=\"inread\"></div>\n<p>During question time, NYSE President Tom Farley&nbsp;asked Ma whether he’s made too much money from Alibaba—gosh, as if that were even possible! Ma is worth $25 billion according to Forbes’ <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/billionaires/#version:realtime\" target=\"_self\">Real-Time Billionaires list</a>. He answered quickly: “I haven’t had time to spend the money.” And then he got philosophical about wealth. “When you have less than $1 million you can be the happiest person in the world. It’s when you have $10 million or more that you start to worry about things like trusts and all that. But when you have $1 billion, it’s not your money. It’s money entrusted to you by others to do more and better things with it.”</p>\n<p>Ma also took a question about fake goods being sold on Alibaba. Ma admits he gets that one a lot, even though he claims that only one out of every 860,000 items on the site are fakes. it’s an existential threat for him, too. Shoppers wouldn’t come back if they ended up getting fake stuff (though that’s debatable). Ma said he used to get death threats from counterfeiters he has shut down with the help of Chinese police. And domestic Chinese brands, he says, are starting to care more about intellectual property. “It’s a war and we’re getting somewhere. With more people’s help, we will win.”</p>"],"disableDigest":false,"writtenByForbesStaff":true,"channelSectionMappings":[{"id":"channel_1","channelName":"Business","url":"/business"},{"id":"channel_1section_146","channelName":"Business","sectionName":"Asia Outlook","url":"/asia-outlook"},{"id":"channel_1section_59","channelName":"Business","sectionName":"Retail","url":"/retail"},{"id":"channel_3","channelName":"Tech","url":"/technology"},{"id":"channel_4","channelName":"Entrepreneurs","url":"/entrepreneurs"},{"id":"channel_8","channelName":"Lists","url":"/lists"},{"id":"channel_8section_54","channelName":"Lists","sectionName":"The World's Billionaires","url":"http://www.forbes.com/billionaires"}],"digestDisabled":false,"images":{"featured":{"url":"http://blogs-images.forbes.com/bruceupbin/files/2015/06/jack-ma-alibaba-ipo-floor-e1411140671454-1940x1091.jpg","width":1940,"height":1091,"title":"jack-ma-alibaba-ipo-floor-e1411140671454-1940x1091","caption":"","description":""}},"brandVoiceTitle":"Jack Ma Says Alibaba Has No Plans To Invade America, It's The Other Way Around","groupAuthor":{"naturalId":"blogAuthorId/blog/author/blog-988","name":"Tradigital","avatars":[{"size":0},{"size":0},{"size":0},{"size":0}],"url":"http://www.forbes.com/sites/bruceupbin/","profileUrl":"http://blogs.forbes.com/bruceupbin/profile/","authorType":"individual","tagName":"News Meets Data","blog":true,"numFollowers":0,"timestamp":1445787654067,"recentFlag":false,"primaryBlogNaturalId":"blogAuthorId/blog/author/blog-988","primaryContributor":"blogAuthorId/blog/author/28","primaryContributorData":{"naturalId":"blogAuthorId/blog/author/28","name":"Bruce Upbin","avatars":[{"size":40,"image":"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/5c374c1933dc22ec2183d6a91ec68e09?s=40&amp;d=http%3A%2F%2F1.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2Fad516503a11cd5ca435acc9bb6523536%3Fs%3D40&amp;r=G"},{"size":62,"image":"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/5c374c1933dc22ec2183d6a91ec68e09?s=62&amp;d=http%3A%2F%2F1.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2Fad516503a11cd5ca435acc9bb6523536%3Fs%3D62&amp;r=G"},{"size":136,"image":"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/5c374c1933dc22ec2183d6a91ec68e09?s=136&amp;d=http%3A%2F%2F1.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2Fad516503a11cd5ca435acc9bb6523536%3Fs%3D136&amp;r=G"},{"size":400,"image":"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/5c374c1933dc22ec2183d6a91ec68e09?s=400&amp;d=http%3A%2F%2F1.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2Fad516503a11cd5ca435acc9bb6523536%3Fs%3D400&amp;r=G"}],"blog":false,"numFollowers":0,"shortBio":"I manage our technology coverage.","description":"I'm a managing editor at Forbes, overseeing our technology coverage online and in print.
