2020 Show Significant Change Expected In Five Short Years","date":1433155740000,"timestamp":1434554586630,"body":"<p>Those with a vested interest in the development of new cancer therapies have been spoiled once again by data presented at the ongoing annual meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO). For the third year in a row, immuno-oncology treatments &ndash; particularly the PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors &ndash; have dominated headlines.\r\n\r\nWith ASCO providing the clinical backdrop it is worth assessing how the commercial landscape for cancer therapies will change through to the end of the decade. A quick analysis of the <a href=\"http://www.firstwordpharma.com/node/1287604?tsid=17#axzz3bj8h6100\">20 best-selling oncology drugs in 2014, versus those forecast to lead the market by 2020</a>, illustrates just how rapidly the treatment paradigm in cancer is expected to evolve.\r\n\r\nThe aforementioned PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors will emerge both clinically and commercially as disruptive agents over the next five years. According to current consensus forecasts &ndash; sourced from [entity display=\"Bloomberg\" type=\"organization\" subtype=\"company\" active=\"true\" key=\"bloomberg\" natural_id=\"fred/company/11849\"]Bloomberg[/entity] &ndash; [entity display=\"Bristol-Myers Squibb\" type=\"organization\" subtype=\"company\" active=\"true\" key=\"bristol-myers-squibb\" ticker=\"BMY\" exchange=\"NYSE\" natural_id=\"fred/company/696\"]Bristol-Myers Squibb[/entity]'s Opdivo will generate sales of $6.2 billion by 2020, while [entity display=\"Merck &amp; Co\" type=\"organization\" subtype=\"company\" active=\"true\" activated=\"true\" deactivated=\"false\" key=\"merck-co\" ticker=\"MRK\" exchange=\"NYSE\" natural_id=\"fred/company/3776\"]Merck &amp; Co[/entity].'s competing therapy Keytruda is expected to achieve revenues of $3.6 billion, positioning them as the fifth and tenth best selling products in 2020, respectively. Both were launched in late 2014. Bullish expectations for the broader PD-1/PD-L1 market support a consensus view that similar products being developed by [entity display=\"Roche\" type=\"organization\" subtype=\"company\" active=\"true\" key=\"roche\" natural_id=\"fred/company/102634\"]Roche[/entity] and [entity display=\"AstraZeneca\" type=\"organization\" subtype=\"company\" active=\"true\" key=\"astrazeneca\" natural_id=\"fred/company/349\"]AstraZeneca[/entity] will also achieve blockbuster status by the end of the decade.\r\n\r\nWhile the commercial opportunity of these agents is in little doubt, whether Bristol-Myers Squibb can lead the market by the margin that consensus forecasts currently anticipate is likely to be reassessed in light of new data presented at ASCO this weekend.\r\n\r\nTo the disappointment of investors (who sent the company's share price down 6.5%) Bristol-Myers Squibb's much anticipated Checkmate-057 study &ndash; assessing Opdivo for non-squamous non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) &ndash; showed a survival benefit only in those patients expressing the PD-L1 biomarker. No benefit was demonstrated in the 40% to 45% of patients lacking this biomarker.\r\n\r\nThe Checkmate-057 study results not only raise questions about the commercial opportunity for Opdivo in lung cancer, but Bristol-Myers Squibb's stance towards PD-L1 testing in this indication. \"Investor consensus has clearly been skewed towards believing in Bristol-Myers Squibb's point of view (which has minimized the importance of PD-L1 testing), as evidenced by consensus estimates for Opdivo substantially exceeding those of its competitors,\" wrote Bernstein analyst Tim Anderson in a note to investors published on Friday.\r\n\r\nNot only is the playing field for the PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors \"likely to be more level than this,\" adds Anderson, but PD-L1 testing could emerge as a \"potential point of differentiation and a possible source of market or pricing/reimbursement advantage.\" Notably, in addition to positioning PD-L1 testing at the center of development and commercial strategies from the outset, both Merck and Roche are now advancing immuno-oncology biomarker testing beyond PD-L1 status.\r\n<!--donotpaginate-->\r\nAnother potential event in the oncology market over the next five years could be emergence of the first $10 billion-a-year cancer treatment, with Celgene's Myeloma therapy Revlimid poised to achieve this status, according to consensus forecasts. In the process, Roche would concede long running ownership of the industry's biggest selling cancer drug; indeed, the Swiss company currently markets the three best selling brands in Avastin, Herceptin and Rituxan. Roche will remain, however, oncology market leader and powerhouse, with its position at the forefront of personalized medicine becoming ever more important.\r\n\r\nConversely, the rate at which potential biosimilar launches erode sales of leading biologic therapies &ndash; particularly Roche's Rituxan and Herceptin franchises &ndash; will be watched with great interest, while healthcare providers and payers will rejoice at the loss of patent exclusivity for Novartis' Gleevec, which has revolutionized the treatment of chronic myeloid leukaemia. A rare high-profile patent expiry among the current list of best-selling cancer treatments, sales of Gleevec are forecast&nbsp;to plummet from $4.7 billion in 2014 to around $570 million by 2020.\r\n\r\nSuch cost-saving opportunities remain scarce in the oncology market, however. A factor, when combined with the price of new cancer treatments &ndash; many of which are likely to be used in expensive combinations &ndash; which has seen <a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/high-prices-for-drugs-attacked-at-meeting-1433119411?mod=rss_Health\">affordability emerge as another key theme</a> at this year's ASCO meeting.\r\n\r\n<em><strong>Also on Forbes:</strong></em>\r\n\r\n[gallery2012]</p>","description":"Those with a vested interest in the development of new cancer therapies have been spoiled once again by data presented at the ongoing annual meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO).

Both were launched in late 2014. Bullish expectations for the broader PD-1/PD-L1 market support a consensus view that similar products being developed by <span class=\"quotecard\" article-quote-card=\"\" data-ticker=\"null\" data-exchange=\"null\" data-type=\"organization\" data-naturalid=\"fred/company/102634\" data-quotes-closing=\"0.0\" data-quotes-now=\"0.0\" data-link=\"/companies/roche\" data-name=\"Roche\"></span> and <span class=\"quotecard\" article-quote-card=\"\" data-ticker=\"null\" data-exchange=\"null\" data-type=\"organization\" data-naturalid=\"fred/company/349\" data-quotes-closing=\"0.0\" data-quotes-now=\"0.0\" data-link=\"/companies/astrazeneca\" data-name=\"AstraZeneca\"></span> will also achieve blockbuster status by the end of the decade.</p>\n<p>While the commercial opportunity of these agents is in little doubt, whether Bristol-Myers Squibb can lead the market by the margin that consensus forecasts currently anticipate is likely to be reassessed in light of new data presented at ASCO this weekend.</p>\n<div id=\"inread\" article-ad-inbody=\"inread\" class=\"inread\"></div>\n<p>To the disappointment of investors (who sent the company’s share price down 6.5%) Bristol-Myers Squibb’s much anticipated Checkmate-057 study – assessing Opdivo for non-squamous non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) – showed a survival benefit only in those patients expressing the PD-L1 biomarker. No benefit was demonstrated in the 40% to 45% of patients lacking this biomarker.</p>\n<p>The Checkmate-057 study results not only raise questions about the commercial opportunity for Opdivo in lung cancer, but Bristol-Myers Squibb’s stance towards PD-L1 testing in this indication. “Investor consensus has clearly been skewed towards believing in Bristol-Myers Squibb’s point of view (which has minimized the importance of PD-L1 testing), as evidenced by consensus estimates for Opdivo substantially exceeding those of its competitors,” wrote Bernstein analyst Tim Anderson in a note to investors published on Friday.</p>\n<div class=\"vestpocket\" vest-pocket=\"\"></div>\n<p>Not only is the playing field for the PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors “likely to be more level than this,” adds Anderson, but PD-L1 testing could emerge as a “potential point of differentiation and a possible source of market or pricing/reimbursement advantage.” Notably, in addition to positioning PD-L1 testing at the center of development and commercial strategies from the outset, both Merck and Roche are now advancing immuno-oncology biomarker testing beyond PD-L1 status.</p>\n<p>Another potential event in the oncology market over the next five years could be emergence of the first $10 billion-a-year cancer treatment, with Celgene’s Myeloma therapy Revlimid poised to achieve this status, according to consensus forecasts. In the process, Roche would concede long running ownership of the industry’s biggest selling cancer drug; indeed, the Swiss company currently markets the three best selling brands in Avastin, Herceptin and Rituxan. Roche will remain, however, oncology market leader and powerhouse, with its position at the forefront of personalized medicine becoming ever more important.</p>\n<p>Conversely, the rate at which potential biosimilar launches erode sales of leading biologic therapies – particularly Roche’s Rituxan and Herceptin franchises – will be watched with great interest, while healthcare providers and payers will rejoice at the loss of patent exclusivity for Novartis’ Gleevec, which has revolutionized the treatment of chronic myeloid leukaemia. A rare high-profile patent expiry among the current list of best-selling cancer treatments, sales of Gleevec are forecast&nbsp;to plummet from $4.7 billion in 2014 to around $570 million by 2020.</p>\n<p>Such cost-saving opportunities remain scarce in the oncology market, however. A factor, when combined with the price of new cancer treatments – many of which are likely to be used in expensive combinations – which has seen <a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/high-prices-for-drugs-attacked-at-meeting-1433119411?mod=rss_Health\">affordability emerge as another key theme</a> at this year’s ASCO meeting.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Also on Forbes:</strong></em></p>\n<div class=\"article-gallery-embedded\" data-url=\"http://www.forbes.com/pictures/fife45fhe/no-1-johnson-johnson/\"> \n <div class=\"embedded-content clearfix\"> \n  <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/pictures/fife45fhe/no-1-johnson-johnson/\" class=\"clearfix\" target=\"_self\"> \n   <div class=\"article-image-box\"> \n    <!--start:main_image--> \n    <img src=\"http://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/810c704ce72e449abd0e0dd9f211df1b/400x400.jpg?fit=scale&amp;background=000000\" alt=\"\" /> \n    <!--end:main_image--> \n   </div> \n   <div class=\"article-text-box\"> \n    <header> \n     <i class=\"icon icon-gallery\"></i>Gallery \n    </header> \n    <h4>Global 2000: The Biggest Drug Companies Of 2015</h4> \n    <div class=\"article-launch-gallery\"> \n     <span class=\"article-launch-text\">Launch Gallery</span> \n     <div class=\"article-slide-count\">\n       15 images \n     </div> \n    </div> \n    <button class=\"article-launch-button\"><i class=\"icon icon-chevron-right\"></i></button> \n   </div></a> \n </div> \n</div>"],"galleryId":"554a6167e4b0bacdbd74ee39","disableDigest":false,"writtenByForbesStaff":false,"channelSectionMappings":[{"id":"channel_1","channelName":"Business","url":"/business"},{"id":"channel_1section_4","channelName":"Business","sectionName":"Pharma & Healthcare","url":"/healthcare"}],"brandVoiceTitle":"The Biggest Selling Cancer Drugs In 2020 Show Significant Change Expected In Five Short Years","digestDisabled":false,"individualAuthor":{"naturalId":"blogAuthorId/blog/author/657181","name":"Simon King","avatars":[{"size":40,"image":"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/730eee22735eaf60731a57f88d7fbcfb?s=40&amp;d=http%3A%2F%2F1.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2Fad516503a11cd5ca435acc9bb6523536%3Fs%3D40&amp;r=G"},{"size":62,"image":"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/730eee22735eaf60731a57f88d7fbcfb?s=62&amp;d=http%3A%2F%2F1.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2Fad516503a11cd5ca435acc9bb6523536%3Fs%3D62&amp;r=G"},{"size":136,"image":"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/730eee22735eaf60731a57f88d7fbcfb?s=136&amp;d=http%3A%2F%2F1.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2Fad516503a11cd5ca435acc9bb6523536%3Fs%3D136&amp;r=G"},{"size":400,"image":"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/730eee22735eaf60731a57f88d7fbcfb?s=400&amp;d=http%3A%2F%2F1.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2Fad516503a11cd5ca435acc9bb6523536%3Fs%3D400&amp;r=G"}],"url":"http://www.forbes.com/sites/simonking/","type":"Contributor","profileUrl":"/sites/simonking/","twitterName":"@fwpharma","authorType":"individual","email":"simon.king@firstword-pharma.com","blog":false,"numFollowers":0,"shortBio":"I focus on the bigger picture in Big Pharma.","timestamp":1445791566928,"description":"I’m the executive editor at FirstWord Pharma – providing the latest global news, insights, analysis and views on the pharmaceutical industry.
