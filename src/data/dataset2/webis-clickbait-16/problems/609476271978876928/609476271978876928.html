Using unseen footage and the reminiscences of friends speaking for the first time since her death, a new documentary film sets the record straight.</h3><p><em>By</em> <strong>Jessamy Calkin</strong>  </p></div><div class="block text-block"><p>In the summer of 2011 Nick Shymansky and his girlfriend were walking past the Gate cinema in Notting Hill on the way back from registering their marriage. The cinema was showing Senna, a documentary film about the life of the racing driver Ayrton Senna. They had heard it was good and decided to go, despite having no interest in Formula One, and Shymansky was ‘blown away by it’. Wouldn’t it be great if someone could make a film like that about Amy, he said.   </p><p>Six weeks later Amy Winehouse was dead. She was 27.  </p><p>Early in 2012 the producer of Senna, James Gay-Rees, received a text from David Joseph, the CEO of Winehouse’s record company, Universal. Would he like to make a film about Winehouse in the vein of Senna – a blend of archive footage and voiceovers – with full access? Gay-Rees was immediately keen, and his first call was to Senna’s director, Asif Kapadia, who also said yes, provided he could talk to anyone he wanted to. With Senna, people had been clamouring to be involved. ‘This was much harder,’ Gay-Rees says. ‘There was a sort of inner sanctum of Amy’s friends who took a vow of silence after her funeral. There were huge trust issues involved – some people took 18 months to convince.’  </p></div><figure class="block quote-block">  <blockquote><p>“Some of Amy’s friends took a vow of silence after her funeral”  </p></blockquote>  </figure><div class="block text-block"><p>They had Universal’s backing, and the cooperation of the Amy Winehouse estate. In the end they conducted more than 100 interviews with Winehouse’s friends and collaborators, Kapadia recording but not filming. ‘I just sat there in a room with a microphone,’ he says. ‘I turned the lights off and we sat in the dark and talked. It became the technique for this film because it was so personal.Sometimes people wouldn’t want to talk, or they’d agree to talk just for 10 minutes, then it would become an hour, two hours, five hours…’ One person would lead to another person, or maybe four or five people, and quite often they would also have photographs or a bit of film to contribute.   </p><p>Kapadia and Gay-Rees didn’t have any particular narrative in mind. ‘Senna and Amy are both icons, but you’ve got to refresh it and say something that hasn’t been said before, ideally,’ Gay-Rees says. ‘We had no agenda, no preconceived idea of what story we wanted to tell, which is why in some ways it was more challenging, because it had to be found.  </p><p>‘You’re not going to get to the bottom of somebody’s issues, especially addiction [to heroin, crack cocaine and alcohol, in Winehouse’s case], in a two-hour movie –you could spend a lifetime trying to work out what’s going on there. So we just tried to get the balance right by suggesting what factors may be at play, but we’re not psychotherapists, we’re filmmakers interpreting material. So we had to run all these threads concurrently. We didn’t want to focus only on the downside [of Winehouse’s life], which people are aware of, because it became important to spend time with the earlier Amy.’  </p></div><div class="block html-block"><img src="http://i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03331/SCHOOL_INS_Winehou_3331783a.JPG"><p class="caption">Amy Winehouse, aged eight. INS News Agency</p></div><div class="block text-block"><p>‘The longer version of the film that we had was really, really painful to view,’ Kapadia says. ‘There was a lot of stuff that was just too harsh to show.’  </p><p>Nick Shymansky, Winehouse’s first manager and a close friend, was a key contributor. But after the media furore surrounding her death he had never spoken on the record to anyone about her – ‘except a two-minute chat with her father, Mitch [for his 2012 book Amy, My Daughter], which I really didn’t want to do, and once for Radio 2 about the making of [her debut album] Frank’ – and he was reluctant to do so. ‘I was quite cynical about whether they would be able to open the Pandora’s Box and get to the core of Amy without being controlled or manipulated or shut down.’  </p><p>It took months of persuasion for Shymansky to change his mind. In the end he couldn’t stop talking – Kapadia got 15 hours of taped interview with him. ‘What pisses me off about Amy’s legacy is, considering the impact she made, it’s all been very lightweight,’ Shymansky tells me. ‘But when I met Asif it didn’t take long for me to realise that this guy is f***ing smart and was asking questions that I didn’t realise I wanted to be asked.’ Kapadia, Shymansky realised, was trying to get to the heart of Winehouse, ‘not what drugs she was taking or who she pissed off. He wanted to know about the person.’   </p></div><figure class="block quote-block">  <blockquote><p>“She looks right at the camera – it’s quite uncomfortable at times”  </p></blockquote>  </figure><div class="block text-block"><p>Kapadia had never met Winehouse or seen her play live. ‘I generally make films about subjects that I don’t know too much about,’ he says. ‘I’ve never made a music video before but it seemed quite early on that her music would be the spine of the film; it felt like this would be my musical, where songs are the narrative, songs are the journey.’  </p><p>Kapadia was very taken with her lyrics. ‘It was a revelation to me what an amazing writer she was; she had a unique style. So it became the story of an artist, a young girl who’s clever, who took personal stories and turned them into songs,gave them twists and humour.’ They had access to her notebooks – and throughout the film her arch, autobiographical, rather poignant lyrics appear on the screen in her girlish writing (‘You always hurt the ones you love / That’s why I had to twist the blade / Goodbyes aren’t my forte / Hat tipped, you go your way’).  </p><p>As with Senna, <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/film/amy/"><strong>Amy</strong></a> has no overall narrator, and no talking heads. It is made up of an agile montage of voiceovers, archive footage and still photographs, seamlessly edited by Chris King, the third member of the Senna team. The filmmakers had access to Winehouse’s computer, but a lot of material had to be sourced. Shymansky provided some early footage, which Kapadia says was ‘like gold’. There is Winehouse playing guitar, and waking up in the back of Shymansky’scar. ‘One of the things I really like is that she looks right at the camera, at her audience, that’s very unusual – it’s quite uncomfortable at times,’ Kapadia says.  </p></div>  </div>  </div><script>  //IE9 fix to stop audio playing  var video = document.getElementById('video-text-1608')    if (video){      video.muted = true;    }</script><div id="text-1612" class="section section-text inner-column-centered "  >    <div class="main-column">    <div class="block text-block"></div>  </div>  </div><script>  //IE9 fix to stop audio playing  var video = document.getElementById('video-text-1612')    if (video){      video.muted = true;    }</script><style>      .section-text-over-media-8753 {      background-image: url(./media/shand_big_teen_p18290.juliette-hr.jpg);    }    .lt-ie9 .section-text-over-media-8753 {      -ms-filter: "progid:DXImageTransform.Microsoft.AlphaImageLoader(src='./media/shand_big_teen_p18290.juliette-hr.jpg', sizingMethod='scale')";    }    @media (max-width: 755px){      .section-text-over-media-8753 {        background-image: url(./media/shand_big_teen_p18290.juliette-lr.jpg);      }    }    @media (min-width: 755px) and (max-width: 1400px) {      .section-text-over-media-8753 {        background-image: url(./media/shand_big_teen_p18290.juliette-mr.jpg);      }    }          @media (max-aspect-ratio: 1/1) {        .section-text-over-media-8753 {          background-image: url(./media/shand_portrait_teen_p18290.juliette-hr.jpg);        }        @media (max-width: 755px){          .section-text-over-media-8753 {            background-image: url(./media/shand_portrait_teen_p18290.juliette-lr.jpg);          }        }        @media (min-width: 755px) and (max-width: 1400px) {          .section-text-over-media-8753 {            background-image: url(./media/shand_portrait_teen_p18290.juliette-mr.jpg);          }        }      }      </style><div id="text-over-media-8753" class="section section-text-over-media section-text-over-image section-text-over-media-8753 " data-viewport-height>  <div class="text text-over-media-inner center center normal">          <strong class="text-inner">              </strong>      </div>  <div class="background-overlay">      </div>      <p class="caption text-over-media-caption main-text-is-center">Winehouse and her friend Juliette Ashby as teenagers.</p>    <img alt="Winehouse and her friend Juliette Ashby as teenagers." data-landscape-src="./media/shand_big_teen_p18290.juliette-hr.jpg" data-portrait-src="./media/shand_portrait_teen_p18290.juliette-hr.jpg" class="section-background-image text-over-media-background-image retina-only" data-autoscale="cover"></div><script>(function() {  //IE9 fix to stop audio playing  var video = document.getElementById('video-text-over-media-8753');  if (video){    video.muted = true;  }  var section = document.getElementById('text-over-media-8753');  // Chrome on MacBook Retina  if (Device.isMacRetinaChrome()) {    var backgroundImage = document.querySelector('#text-over-media-8753 .section-background-image');    var srcProperty = 'landscapeSrc';    if (Shorthand.helpers.isPortrait() && backgroundImage.dataset.portraitSrc.length) {      srcProperty = 'portraitSrc';    }    backgroundImage.src = backgroundImage.dataset[srcProperty];    backgroundImage.style.display = 'block';    section.style.backgroundImage = 'none';  }  ViewportHeight.attachTo(section);}());</script><div id="text-1613" class="section section-text inner-column-centered "  >    <div class="main-column">    <div class="block text-block"><p>‘She’s always direct, she’s honest, she’s frank, and she looks you right in <br />the eye.’ There is footage of Winehouse larking around in Majorca on holiday, footage of her and Blake Fielder-Civil on their wedding day in Miami, and a painful grainy clip of Fielder-Civil cajoling her to sing her hit Rehab (with a chorus of ‘yes, yes, yes’) – while they were actually in rehab.  </p><p>Once Shymansky came on board, so did Wine­house’s childhood friends Juliette Ashby and Lauren Gilbert. There are interviews with musicians and producers she worked with, including Mark Ronson, Mos Def (‘She was fast with a blue joke,she could drink anyone under the table and she had a big giant laugh’), and Salaam Remi, who produced Frank in 2003 and some of her second album, Back to Black.   </p><p>‘He gave us his photos, beautiful pictures of her playing guitar in his garden – nobody has ever seen those,’ Kapadia says. ‘Initially there was no way he was going to give these pictures up, because they’re personal. He said, “She was my friend, I don’t care about the film.” It took ages to get him to trust me. But they loved her and in the end they all wanted the world to know what she was really like.’  </p></div><figure class="block quote-block">  <blockquote><p>Early in her career, Winehouse said, ‘I don’t think I could handle being famous’  </p></blockquote>  </figure><div class="block text-block"><p>Early in her career, Winehouse told an interviewer, ‘I don’t think I’m going to be at all famous. I don’t think I could handle it – I’d probably go mad.’ In Amy there is desperate footage of her hounding by the paparazzi, which is very uncomfortable to watch. Andrew Morris started working for her in June 2008, when she was in the London Clinic undergoing treatment for drug and alcohol addiction; his job was to keep the photographers out and stop people smuggling in drugs to her. When she was discharged he initially slept in his car outside her home. By July he had proved himself indispensable and moved in. ‘She kind of became my entire family,’ he says in the film.  </p><p>‘A lot of people said they’d only speak to us if Andrew spoke to us,’ Gay-Rees says. ‘He was like an endorsement of our credibility. Her security guys would have taken a bullet for her. She inspired such loyalty. Fascinating. I wish I’d met her.’  </p><p>That Winehouse should come out of it well became the mantra for the film, Kapadia says. ‘The same thing happened with Senna – I used to dream about him. You fall in love. You make a film about someone you’ve never met and it starts off as a job and then… we all fell for this girl.’  </p></div><div class="block html-block"><img src="http://i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03331/shand_2003_w_GUITA_3331822a.jpg"><p class="caption">In 2003, the year Winehouse released her debut album, Frank. Retna/Photoshot</p></div><div class="block text-block"><p>Amy Winehouse was not the first singer with addiction problems, not the first to be persecuted by the media – but, as Nick Shymansky puts it, even when her life was a car crash she was still hot. She had a rare talent, an incredible voice and a towering spirit but she was physically slight, even though she did try to build a bigger self with her huge hair, big eye make-up, breast implants and loud tattoos.   </p><p>The voice was there from the start – the film opens with her as a child singing Happy Birthday. She grew up in north London. Her father, Mitch, was a window installer (later a cab driver), who liked to sing himself; her mother, Janis, was a pharmacist. When Amy was 10, her parents divorced. Mitch maintains that their son, Alex, took it very badly while Amy seemed to accept it, but the film implies it was a defining influence on her life.   </p><p>In Mitch’s book two stories leap out about her childhood: how when he picked her up from school in his convertible and stopped at traffic lights she would stand up and sing at the top of her voice; and that at Ashmole, her secondary school in Southgate, the headmistress always knew who was being sent to see her because she would hear Fly Me to the Moon being sung loudly all the way up the corridor.  </p></div><figure class="block quote-block">  <blockquote><p>“When we met, she was a chubby, quiet, Jewish teenager”   </p></blockquote>  </figure><div class="block text-block"><p>Aftera short spell at Ashmole, Amy went to Sylvia Young Theatre School aged 12 and ended up at the Brit School for performing arts in Croydon. In 1999, when she was 16, she joined the National Youth Jazz Orchestra.   </p><p>‘We would rehearse in the Cockpit Theatre in Edgware Road; I’d play the piano,’ her teacher Annabel Williams tells me. ‘Amy and I had a lot of the same influences, like Dinah Washington and Ella Fitzgerald. She was a chubby, quiet, Jewish teenager. The first time I met her she just stood in the middle of the room and sang a song – and she just had this tone. The NYJO pieces were the hardest you could do, phrasing-wise, and she just did it note-perfectly, first time. I thought, wow, that’s annoying.’  </p><p>At around the same time Winehouse came to the attention of Shymansky, via her friend Tyler James, also a singer. Shymansky worked with Nick Godwyn at the PR company Brilliant!, and shortly after, for Simon Fuller’s newly set-up XIX Entertainment. Shymansky had to chase her to send him a tape. He played it for the first time in his car – a badly recorded cassette of Winehouse singing a couple of jazz standards. When he heard her voice, he says, he had to pullover. ‘I thought, holy shit. What do I do next? How do we get her before someone else does?’  </p></div>  </div>  </div><script>  //IE9 fix to stop audio playing  var video = document.getElementById('video-text-1613')    if (video){      video.muted = true;    }</script><div id="text-1614" class="section section-text inner-column-centered "  >    <div class="main-column">    <div class="block text-block"></div>  </div>  </div><script>  //IE9 fix to stop audio playing  var video = document.getElementById('video-text-1614')    if (video){      video.muted = true;    }</script><style>      .section-text-over-media-8754 {      background-image: url(./media/shand_blake_rexfeatures_669564f-hr.jpg);    }    .lt-ie9 .section-text-over-media-8754 {      -ms-filter: "progid:DXImageTransform.Microsoft.AlphaImageLoader(src='./media/shand_blake_rexfeatures_669564f-hr.jpg', sizingMethod='scale')";    }    @media (max-width: 755px){      .section-text-over-media-8754 {        background-image: url(./media/shand_blake_rexfeatures_669564f-lr.jpg);      }    }    @media (min-width: 755px) and (max-width: 1400px) {      .section-text-over-media-8754 {        background-image: url(./media/shand_blake_rexfeatures_669564f-mr.jpg);      }    }          @media (max-aspect-ratio: 1/1) {        .section-text-over-media-8754 {          background-image: url(./media/shand_portrait_blake_rexfeatures_669564f-hr.jpg);        }        @media (max-width: 755px){          .section-text-over-media-8754 {            background-image: url(./media/shand_portrait_blake_rexfeatures_669564f-lr.jpg);          }        }        @media (min-width: 755px) and (max-width: 1400px) {          .section-text-over-media-8754 {            background-image: url(./media/shand_portrait_blake_rexfeatures_669564f-mr.jpg);          }        }      }      </style><div id="text-over-media-8754" class="section section-text-over-media section-text-over-image section-text-over-media-8754 " data-viewport-height>  <div class="text text-over-media-inner center center normal">          <strong class="text-inner">              </strong>      </div>  <div class="background-overlay">      </div>      <p class="caption text-over-media-caption main-text-is-center">Winehouse with her husband, Blake Fielder-Civil, in June 2007.

Even very early on she was resistant to these meetings. Or she would turn up at the wrong place. ‘Behind the absent-mindedness,’ Godwyn has said, ‘there was an element of her being unsure of committing, because she thought she was giving in to something, but I told her, you are not giving in, you now have an outlet that allows you to express what you want to do. She was always kicking against something.’  </p><p>In early footage, Winehouse looks really fun to be around – gobby, irreverent and witty. She was naturally tricky. ‘But it was always workable,’ Shymansky says. ‘It was just challenging. You can imagine us at meetings with record companies where some egotistical A&amp;R guy was blowing smoke up her arse; I’d want to nail the deal and Amy picked up on me wanting to be taken seriously, and she’d do everything she could to make me look unprofessional. So on the way there I’d say, “Amy, you know how in the last meeting you put your hand on my hand – you shouldn’t do that.” Amy would say, “Yeah, sorry – I get it.” Then in the next meeting she’d come and sit on my lap. I’d go bright red and make a joke out of it, and she’d say, “Oh chill out, Nicky, it’s funny.” ’   </p><p>In 2001 Shymansky and XIX secured Winehouse a publishing deal with EMI with an advance of £250,000, and the following year she signed to Island/Universal.  </p></div><figure class="block quote-block">  <blockquote><p>“She’d do everything she could to make me look unprofessional”   </p></blockquote>  </figure><div class="block text-block"><p>For someone who had such a dedicated relationship with music, Winehouse’s early career was marked by the same lack of ambition that came to characterise her life. Initially she would sing in small jazz clubs. ‘Amy always used to say to me that that was her dream, really, to play in jazz clubs to small audiences,’ her keyboard player Sam Beste says in the film. ‘She had one of the most pure relationships to music, such an emotional relationship. She needed music as if it were a person and she would die for it.’  </p><p>Her first album, Frank, was a critical success and has since sold more than a million copies. But, according to Shymansky, ‘She wasn’t happy with it because she was forced to include two songs that she hated.’ Winehouse was in her element recording it in Miami, and being in the studio with other musicians,working things out, was where she felt comfortable. It was the other stuff she didn’t like.   </p><p>‘I figured out early on that you had to make things fun,’ Shymansky says. ‘It’s not money or discipline that tie Amy to music – it’s having a good time.’ She was chaotic and diffident long before the drugs, and chronically late for everything, but, Shymansky says, ‘the connection between me and her was consistent from day one’.   </p></div><div class="block html-block"><img src="http://i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03331/shand_PERFORMING_r_3331862a.jpg"><p class="caption">At Earls Court, 2007, with Dale Davis. Rex Features</p></div><div class="block text-block"><p>But, in the space of a week, everything changed. ‘It was around February 2005. I know that because I was on a skiing trip with my family and I called her five days into the holiday, and she sounded different. I remember saying to my brother, “Something weird is going on. Amy doesn’t sound like Amy.”   </p><p>‘That was the week she met Blake Fielder-Civil. Amy changed overnight. For six years she was completely consistent and then all of a sudden it was like dealing with a different person. There were glimpses of the Amy I knew right up until the end, but something really changed. My view at the time, and my view now, is that she was intoxicated with heavy drugs as soon as she met Blake.’  </p><p>This was the person who would chant ‘Class A drugs are for mugs’ at the beginning of her shows. Although she smoked weed and was already a fairly big drinker, the accepted version – in the film too – is that Winehouse didn’t take crack or heroin until after she and Fielder-Civil were married, although he had been taking heroin for longer. Shymansky thinks it started earlier. ‘She’d be talking gibberish. And then all of a sudden she had a stammer. That was the thing that really upset me.’  </p></div><figure class="block quote-block">  <blockquote><p>“She’d be talking gibberish. And then all of a sudden she had a stammer”  </p></blockquote>  </figure><div class="block text-block"><p>When Fielder-Civil went back to his ex-girlfriend after a few months, it was the start of a period of madness and chaos that was to last four years. Winehouse flipped out, and turned furiously to alcohol. When it became critical, Shymansky and Godwyn tried to put her in rehab, but at the time her father thought she didn’t need to go.   </p><p>(When she told Mark Ronson that story, he suggested she turn it into a song: Rehab became the pivotal hit of her career.)  </p><p>‘Up until probably March 2006, not long before Back to Black was recorded and delivered, it was a nightmare,’ Shymansky says. ‘There were lots of arguments, lots of passionate conversations. It was absolutely clear to me that she wasn’t well and she needed help.’  </p><p>Winehouse wanted Shymanksy to leave XIX and manage her full-time. He thought it would be disloyal to Simon Fuller, and when he said he wouldn’t unless she let him help her get off drugs, her promoter Raye Cosbert became her manager. From then on her career was largely in the hands of Cosbert, Island Records and her father.  </p><p>Winehouse and Fielder-Civil married secretly in Florida in May 2007. They had a druggy relationship, but Kapadia is convinced she really loved him. He talks about a look she gives Blake at a photo shoot with Terry Richardson in New York, a look that is captured in the film. ‘That is someone madly in love; a girl who is embarrassed, who can’t contain how much she is in love with this guy.’  </p></div>  </div>  </div><script>  //IE9 fix to stop audio playing  var video = document.getElementById('video-text-1615')    if (video){      video.muted = true;    }</script><div id="text-1616" class="section section-text inner-column-centered "  >    <div class="main-column">    <div class="block text-block"></div>  </div>  </div><script>  //IE9 fix to stop audio playing  var video = document.getElementById('video-text-1616')    if (video){      video.muted = true;    }</script><style>      .section-text-over-media-8755 {      background-image: url(./media/shand_ronson_91149492-hr.jpg);    }    .lt-ie9 .section-text-over-media-8755 {      -ms-filter: "progid:DXImageTransform.Microsoft.AlphaImageLoader(src='./media/shand_ronson_91149492-hr.jpg', sizingMethod='scale')";    }    @media (max-width: 755px){      .section-text-over-media-8755 {        background-image: url(./media/shand_ronson_91149492-lr.jpg);      }    }    @media (min-width: 755px) and (max-width: 1400px) {      .section-text-over-media-8755 {        background-image: url(./media/shand_ronson_91149492-mr.jpg);      }    }          @media (max-aspect-ratio: 1/1) {        .section-text-over-media-8755 {          background-image: url(./media/shand_portrait_ronson_91149492-hr.jpg);        }        @media (max-width: 755px){          .section-text-over-media-8755 {            background-image: url(./media/shand_portrait_ronson_91149492-lr.jpg);          }        }        @media (min-width: 755px) and (max-width: 1400px) {          .section-text-over-media-8755 {            background-image: url(./media/shand_portrait_ronson_91149492-mr.jpg);          }        }      }      </style><div id="text-over-media-8755" class="section section-text-over-media section-text-over-image section-text-over-media-8755 " data-viewport-height>  <div class="text text-over-media-inner center center normal">          <strong class="text-inner">              </strong>      </div>  <div class="background-overlay">      </div>      <p class="caption text-over-media-caption main-text-is-center">On stage with Mark Ronson at Earls Court, 2008.

It reached number one in the UK album chart the following January. By the end of 2011 it had sold 3.5 million copies in the UK and 20 million worldwide. ‘It occurred to me recently that one of the biggest-selling UK albums of the 21st century so far is all about the biggest low-life scumbag that God ever put breath into,’ Mitch Winehouse writes in his book. ‘Quite ironic, isn’t it?’  </p><p>‘When the album came out everything went through the roof,’ Shymansky says. ‘I could see what was happening, but I had no influence on it any more.’ Shymansky and her friends Juliette Ashby and Lauren Gilbert adopted a tough-love approach. ‘The advice I was given was that when you really care about someone with an addiction, you have to be very firm,’ Shymansky says.   </p><p>‘You want no part of anything other than them getting better. But Amy would call me as if nothing had happened. She’d say, are you coming to this gig tomorrow night, and I’d say, have you forgotten I’m not part of this any more? And then it got ugly, really ugly. The next four years were appalling.’  </p></div><figure class="block quote-block">  <blockquote><p>Blake Fielder-Civil’s parents dubbed Mitch Winehouse the Fat Controller  </p></blockquote>  </figure><div class="block text-block"><p>For his part, Mitch Winehouse describes in his book a litany of Amy’s broken promises, good intentions, relapses, crises, with him rushing around after her trying to help. He is full of self-justification and swagger – always kicking drug dealers out of her flat and going on about how Amy loved to hear him sing – and it is clear that he is very controlling (Fielder-Civil’s parents dubbed him the Fat Controller, which to his credit he thought was funny).   </p><p>He treated Amy like a child, but at the root of it all is a man who absolutely loved his daughter, and you can’t help feeling that he was tireless, if at times misguided, in his devotion to her. But he couldn’t control her addictions. Nobody could.  </p><p>Along with her other problems, Winehouse suffered from bulimia. In the film, her mother says that when Amy was 15 she told her about a ‘great diet’ where she could eat anything she wanted and then throw it up afterwards. Her mother thought it would pass. It didn’t.   </p><p>In August 2006, after a recording session during which she drank a lot of whisky and Coke, the studio manager discovered Winehouse had ‘redecorated’ the bathroom – vomit mixed with mascara smeared all over the walls. Pictures of a bony, haggard Winehouse in tiny denim shorts began to dominate the newspapers.  </p></div><div class="block html-block"><img src="http://i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03331/shand_BODYGUARD_re_3331877a.jpg"><p class="caption">Winehouse with her bodyguard Andrew Morris in Camden, August 2009.

Shortly afterwards Fielder-Civil was arrested on a charge of grievous bodily harm; his subsequent attempt to pervert the course of justice at his GBH trial landed him in jail. Even with him out of the picture, things did not improve.   </p><p>When she was nominated for the Grammys in 2008, she was in such a bad way that Lucian Grainge, the head of Universal UK, worried that she might make a fool of herself. He drew up a contract, which they both signed, saying that she couldn’t perform at the Grammys unless she was drug-free and that she would have to have a urine test to prove it. By the time of the awards, ‘Amy was completely clean,’ Grainge said. ‘God bless her – she did it.’  </p><p>In the end she performed You Know I’m No Good and Rehab via satellite link from London, and won five Grammys, with Tony Bennett announcing Rehab as Record of the Year. Her family were all with her, and her friends, and she looked fantastic. But there was a poignant epitaph. ‘I was so overwhelmed,’ Juliette Ashby says. ‘I said, “I can’t believe this is happening… I am so proud of you.” She went, “Jules, this is so boring without drugs.” And I felt really, really, really sad for her.'  </p></div><figure class="block quote-block">  <blockquote><p>“She said, ‘This is so boring without drugs’”  </p></blockquote>  </figure><div class="block text-block"><p>Winehouse never made another album (Lioness: Hidden Treasures, a collection of unreleased songs and demos, was put out after she died). She often cancelled gigs or performed drunk; asked to record the theme tune for the Bond film Quantum of Solace with Mark Ronson, she barely made it into the studio and it never happened. In 2008 she was in and out of the London Clinic as if it were a hotel.   </p><p>Nick Godwyn doesn’t buy the allegations made after her death that she was pushed too hard. ‘I’d dispute any of the recent claims that she was pushed into anything,’ he has said, ‘or that people weren’t trying to help. Her record company hadn’t asked her to do anything since 2007. They’d even turned down music, which must have hurt her a lot. They just wanted her better. Her family were devoted to her and paid heavily themselves… I know artists who have one day off in a year. Before she got ill, you were lucky if Amy did 30 days in a year.’  </p><p>In 2009 Winehouse and Fielder-Civil were divorced and she finally stopped taking heroin and crack. She bought a house in Camden Square in 2010, and moved in the following January. But she was still binge drinking. She was admitted to the Priory in May after lapsing into a coma from alcohol abuse. But when she recorded a duet of Body and Soul in March 2011 with Tony Bennett, it all came together again. He describes her in the film as ‘one of the truest jazz singers I ever heard. Up there with Ella Fitzgerald and Billie Holiday.’  </p></div>  </div>  </div><script>  //IE9 fix to stop audio playing  var video = document.getElementById('video-text-1618')    if (video){      video.muted = true;    }</script><style>      .section-text-over-media-8756 {      background-image: url(./media/shand_flowers_gettyimages-119802309-hr.jpg);    }    .lt-ie9 .section-text-over-media-8756 {      -ms-filter: "progid:DXImageTransform.Microsoft.AlphaImageLoader(src='./media/shand_flowers_gettyimages-119802309-hr.jpg', sizingMethod='scale')";    }    @media (max-width: 755px){      .section-text-over-media-8756 {        background-image: url(./media/shand_flowers_gettyimages-119802309-lr.jpg);      }    }    @media (min-width: 755px) and (max-width: 1400px) {      .section-text-over-media-8756 {        background-image: url(./media/shand_flowers_gettyimages-119802309-mr.jpg);      }    }          @media (max-aspect-ratio: 1/1) {        .section-text-over-media-8756 {          background-image: url(./media/shand_pt_flowers_gettyimages-119802309-hr.jpg);        }        @media (max-width: 755px){          .section-text-over-media-8756 {            background-image: url(./media/shand_pt_flowers_gettyimages-119802309-lr.jpg);          }        }        @media (min-width: 755px) and (max-width: 1400px) {          .section-text-over-media-8756 {            background-image: url(./media/shand_pt_flowers_gettyimages-119802309-mr.jpg);          }        }      }      </style><div id="text-over-media-8756" class="section section-text-over-media section-text-over-image section-text-over-media-8756 " data-viewport-height>  <div class="text text-over-media-inner center center normal">          <strong class="text-inner">              </strong>      </div>  <div class="background-overlay">      </div>      <p class="caption text-over-media-caption main-text-is-center">Mitch Winehouse and Amy’s boyfriend Reg Traviss inspect floral tributes after her death.

I would randomly get Skyped but it would usually be in the middle of the night and she wouldn’t be in a good place.’ So he was pleased to get the call, but there were paparazzi outside and a security guard at the next table, and other guests staring. Winehouse was just trying to make everything normal.   </p><p>‘But it wasn’t. I remember thinking that she was lonely. It wasn’t flowing, and I couldn’t relax. At the end the security guard pulled out this big wodge of cash. I said, “Whose money is that?” and Amy said, “Who gives a shit, it’s my money.” I said, “How much is there? F***ing hell, Amy, why is everything so loose around you? You don’t know how much money you have, you don’t know who is spending what, you’re not in control of any of it.” ’ And I could tell she was thinking, I don’t want to talk about money, I don’t even care about it.’  </p><p>That was the last time he saw her.  </p><p>In June 2011 she was scheduled to play at the sixth-century Kalemegdan fortress in Belgrade. At the time she was being paid £1 million a gig. ‘We know for a fact that she said to somebody she wanted to do that gig,’ Gay-Rees says, ‘and we know for a fact she said to other people she didn’t want to do it. I think it was quite common behaviour that she would say one thing and then not be particularly keen on that decision later…’  </p></div><figure class="block quote-block">  <blockquote><p>“She was someone who really didn’t care anymore”  </p></blockquote>  </figure><div class="block text-block"><p>‘The material felt so tired and didn’t feel relevant any more,’ Sam Beste, the keyboard player, says in the film, ‘but because she was such a huge star and there was all of these different pressures, she had to keep performing Back to Black.’  </p><p>The concert was a disaster. You see Winehouse doodling around on stage instead of singing, hugging her band members, taking off her shoes, generally looking vacant and out of it. ‘It felt like the end,’ Beste says. ‘It was someone who really didn’t care any more, to the extent where she was willing to sabotage, not just her career, but her friendships and her musical relationships.’  </p><p>The rest of the tour was cancelled. Winehouse was visibly relieved, according to her longstanding bass player, Dale Davis.  </p><p>After Belgrade, there was a change. ‘She rang me up,’ Juliette Ashby says, ‘and she just went “Jules!” and it was my Amy, completely normal and – she had never done this before – she kept saying sorry: “Jules, I’m so sorry. I’m so sorry. I’m so sorry.” You know like when you’re a kid and you panic that you’ve done something wrong and you want to fix it there and then? That’s how it was. I just wanted to go and grab her and bring her back to me, wrap her in my house and not let her out…’   </p><p>The good thing about the tour being cancelled, Winehouse told Ashby, was that she would be able to go to Shymansky’s wedding on July 24.  </p></div><div class="block html-block"><img src="http://i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03331/shand_SHYMANSKY_IM_3331900a.jpg"><p class="caption">With her first manager, Nick Shymansky.</p></div><div class="block text-block"></div>  </div>  </div><script>  //IE9 fix to stop audio playing  var video = document.getElementById('video-text-1619')    if (video){      video.muted = true;    }</script><div id="text-1620" class="section section-text inner-column-centered "  >    <div class="main-column">    <div class="block text-block"><p>Dale Davis saw her a few days before the wedding. ‘It was the best she had looked in years, actually, nearly back to the Amy I had met in 2003. I spoke to her at about 11.30 on Friday night, just chatting on the phone, and then she said, “I’m bored now,” so I said, “OK, Amy, I’ll see you tomorrow night – love you.” And she said, “I love you more…” And that was that.’  </p><p>‘Friday night, she was showing me some clips on her laptop,’ Andrew Morris says in the film. ‘She said, “Boy, I can sing!” I said, “Damn right you can sing.” She said, “If I could give it back just to walk down that street with no hassle, I would.”’  </p><p>When Morris checked on her at her home in Camden in the morning of Saturday July 23 he thought she was asleep. A few hours later he realised she was dead. There were empty vodka bottles in her room. Her alcohol level was 416mg per 100ml of blood – 350mg would have been a fatal dose. She had been drinking for two days,and her father thinks she may have had another fit. It is likely that the abuse her body suffered through years of bulimia would have contributed to her death.The verdict was alcohol poisoning.  </p></div><figure class="block quote-block">  <blockquote><p>“He ran into the garden and shouted out, ‘Amy’s been found dead! ’”  </p></blockquote>  </figure><div class="block text-block"><p>‘I still can’t get over how it happened,’ Shymansky says now, his voice pulsing with emotion. ‘How I found out. I was in my uncle’s garden – we’d just figured out the table placements for the wedding the next day and where Amy and everyone were going to sit. It was the one weekend of the year where the weather was incredible; it had been raining all month, there was the smell of cut grass. All my family from out of town were coming. You couldn’t have a happier occasion to get ruined on the spot. My cousin – and I think he’s still ashamed of it, but he was only a kid at the time – ran into the garden and shouted out, “Amy’s been found dead!” ’  </p><p>It was Shymansky’s mother who persuaded him to carry on. The day after his wedding, Shymansky attended Winehouse’s funeral.<br />Nearly four years later, Kapadia’s Amy was premiered at Cannes to pretty much rapturous reviews. There were a few unhappy people. Kapadia points out the irony: that initially people were reluctant to be in the film, and now some of the same people are complaining they aren’t in it enough. Reg Traviss, Winehouse’s boyfriend for the two years before she died, wasn’t happy (he’s barely in it) and Mitch is upset that the film does not show enough of the positive aspects of his relationship with his daughter.  </p><p>‘You’re trying to get 10 years into two hours,’  Gay-Rees says. ‘It really is difficult and I think the great times that Mitch and Amy shared together are already quite well documented by him and by other people. It sounds brutal, but in the end the film is about her, and they’re all secondary characters. So we tried to make her front and centre as much as we could because there’s much more to her than people realise.’  </p><p>To Shymansky, the film really captures Amy Winehouse. For him, there was no joy in their relationship after 2005. Before 2005, he says, he would need a week to tell me about all the brilliant times they had. ‘And if the film shows one or two per cent of that, I’m happy.’ Because what really upsets him is how her personality is not what has come through in history. Her songs are remembered, but more so the chaos of her life, her addictions, her lurid presence in the media, and her death. ‘But watching it, you see this incredible person who got lost along the way.’ It is, he says, like getting two hours back with his friend Amy.  </p><p><em>Amy is out on July 3</em>  </p><p><em>Visit  <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/film/amy/"><strong>telegraph.co.uk/film/amy</strong></a> to view the trailer and read the review</em>   </p></div><div class="block html-block"><iframe src="//www.facebook.com/plugins/likebox.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2FTELEGRAPH.CO.UK&amp;width&amp;height=62&amp;colorscheme=light&amp;show_faces=false&amp;header=true&amp;stream=false&amp;show_border=false&amp;appId=120118784736295" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="border:none; overflow:hidden; height:62px;" allowTransparency="true"></iframe></div><div class="block text-block"></div>  </div>  </div><script>  //IE9 fix to stop audio playing  var video = document.getElementById('video-text-1620')    if (video){      video.muted = true;    }</script>    </div>  </article>  <script>  performance.mark('sectionsEnd');  </script>    <footer>  <div class="story-footer">    <div class="return-to-top">        <div class="up-arrow">            <a href="#title-3448" class="section-navigator">                <img src="./static/img/chevron-v1.png"/>            </a>        </div>        <div class="up">            <a href="#title-3448" class="section-navigator">TOP</a>        </div>    </div>    <div class="image-container">        <a href="http://www.shorthand.com"> <img src="./static/img/created-with-shorthand.png"/></a>    </div></div></footer>    <script   type="text/javascript" src="./static/js/common.2053.js" charset="utf-8"></script>      <script   type="text/javascript" src="./static/js/story.2053.js" charset="utf-8"></script>  <script>    //TODO: use dfd when autoscale has happened    setTimeout(function() {      $(window).resize();    }, 500);    Response.create({      "prop": "width",      'prefix': 'min-width-',      "breakpoints": [1001, 1401]    });  </script>    <script>        ga('create', 'UA-42055132-1', {'name': 'shorthand' });    ga('shorthand.send', 'pageview', {      'dimension1': 3465,      'dimension2': 236,      'metric1':3465,      'metric2':236    });    $(window).on('load', function() {      try {        performance.measure('startTitleTime', 'fetchStart', 'titleStart');        performance.measure('endTitleTime', 'fetchStart', 'titleEnd');        performance.measure('titleImageLoadedTime', 'fetchStart', 'titleImageLoaded');        performance.measure('elapsedHeadTime', 'headStart', 'headEnd');        performance.measure('endHeadTime', 'fetchStart', 'headEnd');        performance.measure('sectionsStartTime', 'fetchStart', 'sectionsStart');        performance.measure('sectionsEndTime', 'fetchStart', 'sectionsEnd');        performance.measure('elapsedSectionsTime', 'sectionsStart', 'sectionsEnd');      } catch (e) {}    });  </script>          <!--<script type="text/javascript" src="http://cdn.gigya.com/js/socialize.js?apiKey=2_ASmwJuFXoCCY8YP8uB6mzZphj_UToZbQkeeM6bMOA8swtMk2P3Rwu2WSger_DOSt"></script><script type="text/javascript">var act = new gigya.socialize.UserAction();var showShareBarUI_params={ 	containerID: 'componentDiv',	shareButtons: [	{ 		provider: 'Facebook-Like'	},	{ 		provider: 'Twitter-Tweet'	},	{ 		provider: 'googleplus-share'	},	{ 		provider: 'Share',		iconImgUp: 'https://cdns.gigya.com/gs/i/sharebar/icons/share3.png'	}	],	userAction: act}</script><div id="componentDiv"></div><script type="text/javascript">   gigya.socialize.showShareBarUI(showShareBarUI_params);</script>--><script type="text/javascript">_satellite.pageBottom();</script>      </body></html>
