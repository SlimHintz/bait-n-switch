Since Jurassic Park Came Out","date":1433768400000,"timestamp":1433778099709,"body":"<p>Days away from the theaterical release of <em>Jurassic World</em>, the fourth installment of the <em>Jurassic Park</em> series, paleontologists and dinosaur lovers alike are eagerly awaiting the return of the most beloved dinosaur franchise in film history.&nbsp;As a professional dinosaur lover, I've been having fun revisiting what the scientific community has learned from the fossil record since the first <em>Jurassic Park</em> to see what this new film appears to get right about dinosaurs and where it diverges from the consensus.\r\n\r\nScientists have known for decades that dinosaurs are related to birds and were most assuredly covered in feathers. Even though dinosaurs were being depicted in illustrations with feathery coatings as early as the late 1970s, it was not until the early 1990s that the mounting comparative anatomical evidence from fossil discoveries elevated the hypothesis of birds being avian dinosaurs to near universal acceptance in the paleontological community.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_155\" align=\"\" width=\"1940\"]<img class=\"size-large wp-image-155\" src=\"http://blogs-images.forbes.com/shaenamontanari/files/2015/06/2424_SB_00033R.JPG_cmyk-1940x968.jpg\" alt='CHRIS PRATT stars as Owen in \"Jurassic World\".

The days of B-side horror films with tail-dragging dinosaurs were officially over.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nM-RPO10aPY\" target=\"_blank\">As a &ldquo;flock&rdquo; of <em>Gallimimus</em> runs by</a> Dr. Alan Grant in <em>Jurassic Park</em>, he watches their fast, graceful movement and behavior, leans over to the children&nbsp;and says to them, &ldquo;Bet you&rsquo;ll never look at birds the same way again.\"\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_157\" align=\"\" width=\"700\"]<img class=\"size-full wp-image-157\" src=\"http://blogs-images.forbes.com/shaenamontanari/files/2015/06/T._rex_old_posture.jpg\" alt=\"Old, out-dated illustration of T. rex with incorrect posture and wrong skull shape. Illustration by Charles Knight (Image Public Domain via Wikimedia Commons)\"> Old, out-dated illustration of T. rex with incorrect posture and wrong skull shape. Illustration by Charles Knight (Image Public Domain via Wikimedia Commons)[/caption]\r\n\r\nLegendary paleontologist <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Horner_%28paleontologist%29\" target=\"_blank\">Jack Horner</a> was the official paleontological consultant (and partial character inspiration) for the original 1993 Spielberg film and can be thanked for the accurate depiction of dinosaurs as bird relatives. Despite having a paleontologist on board and the evidence showing that dinosaurs were in fact feathered, the dinosaurs in every <em>Jurassic Park</em> film are merely scaled. Artistic license is mainly responsible for this omission&mdash;at the time feathered dinosaurs just did not seem scary. Also then, paleontologists did not know the full scope and breadth of feathers on the evolutionary tree.\r\n\r\nWhile it was clear back then that theropod dinosaurs, the ones most closely related to birds, were feathered, heaps of new fossil finds since the 1990s show that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/science/lost-worlds/2014/jul/24/kulindadromeus-feathers-dinosaur-birds-evolution-siberia-russia\" target=\"_blank\">dinosaurs from all branches of the tree may have had some form of feathers</a>. Although, interestingly, <a href=\"http://rsbl.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/11/6/20150229\" target=\"_blank\">recent research suggest</a>s&nbsp;that the common ancestor of dinosaurs was not feathered and the 'feathery' coating seen in ornithischian dinosaurs arose independently from the feathers of theropods. It seems today all of the dinosaurs in the newest film remain scaly and featherless for both continuity and drama-sake.\r\n<!--nextpage-->\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_61\" align=\"\" width=\"800\"]<img class=\"size-full wp-image-61\" src=\"http://blogs-images.forbes.com/shaenamontanari/files/2015/05/Deinonychus_BW.jpg\" alt=\"Deinonychus, a relative of Velociraptor, would have looked more like this.

(CC-BY 2.5)[/caption]\r\n\r\nIn the new <em>Jurassic World</em>, the genetic engineering of the early 90s takes a leap into the 21st century&mdash;there are&nbsp;not just the clones of the fearsome <em>Velociraptor</em> and gentle <em>Diplodocus</em> roaming the park grounds now, there is a genetically engineered super hybrid dinosaur out to wreck havoc. Could such a thing be created in real life? Can paleontologists create a super-dinosaur that takes on the most dangerous and terrifying characteristics of each one of its components?\r\n\r\nNo way. While scientists are researching how to manipulate&nbsp;genetic material to learn more about dinosaurs, <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/alexknapp/2013/09/14/scientists-demonstrate-that-jurassic-park-couldnt-happen/\" target=\"_blank\">DNA degrades too rapidly </a>for us to ever have enough of a dinosaur genome to sequence directly. Some of the genetic work to be done may include altering birds' existing genetic code in the laboratory to potentially bring out more of their prehistoric characteristics.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_156\" align=\"\" width=\"1940\"]<img class=\"size-large wp-image-156\" src=\"http://blogs-images.forbes.com/shaenamontanari/files/2015/06/2424_TP_00150R.JPG_cmyk-1940x967.jpg\" alt='CHRIS PRATT is surrounded by raptors in \"Jurassic World\". Photo Credit: Universal Pictures and Amblin Entertainment &copy; 2015 Universal Studios and Amblin Entertainment, Inc'> CHRIS PRATT is surrounded by raptors in \"Jurassic World\". Photo Credit: Universal Pictures and Amblin Entertainment[/caption]\r\n\r\nWork in this area is already progressing&mdash;last month a group of researchers from <a href='http://www.forbes.com/colleges/yale-university/'>Yale University</a> published a <a href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/evo.12684/abstract\" target=\"_blank\">paper in the journal of <em>Evolution</em></a> indicating they had altered a chicken&rsquo;s genome in such a way that they were able to transform the typical bird beak into a snout that closely resembled that of its non-avian dinosaur ancestors. In this case, scientists are not adding to the genome in any way, but essentially unlocking the dormant,&nbsp;silent DNA that remains leftover from the non-avian ancestry of the chicken.\r\n\r\nIn <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/srep/2015/150514/srep09840/full/srep09840.html\" target=\"_blank\">another recent study in <em>Scientific Reports</em></a>, researchers were able to make chicken perching digits superficially similar to that of a non-avian dinosaur with embryo modification. The perching digit, called the hallux, was non-opposable in dinosaurs and could not move around in the same manner a modern bird's can. The origin of the modern bird hallux could be intimately tied with the transition of birds from non-avian to capable of flight.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_189\" align=\"\" width=\"1940\"]<img class=\"size-large wp-image-189\" src=\"http://blogs-images.forbes.com/shaenamontanari/files/2015/06/2424_SB_00075NBR.JPG_cmyk-1940x1091.jpg\" alt='The Indominus rex readies her attack in \"Jurassic World\" Photo Credit: Universal Pictures and Amblin Entertainment &copy; 2015 Universal Studios and Amblin Entertainment, Inc'> The Indominus rex readies her attack in \"Jurassic World\" Photo Credit: Universal and Amblin[/caption]\r\n\r\nUnderstanding the genetic differences that lead to physical differences between birds and dinosaurs is allowing &ldquo;reverse genetic engineering&rdquo; to occur on a small scale in the lab. Despite what the movies will have you believe, there is no way we can get a full genome from an extinct non-avian dinosaur by tapping into preserved mosquito blood. A new purebred&nbsp;<em>T. rex</em> will never be created in the laboratory.\r\n\r\nThe conversation of cloning is a lot more serious when paleontologists and geneticists discuss more recently extinct animals like woolly mammoths&mdash;in that case, due to the finds of well-preserved mammoth mummies&mdash;the proper genetic blueprint could actually exist to make this idea more realistic than cloning a dinosaur. In 2011 a<a href=\"http://news.blogs.cnn.com/2011/01/17/scientists-trying-to-clone-resurrect-extinct-mammoth/comment-page-25/\">&nbsp;team in Japan </a>claimed&nbsp;they are going to be producing a woolly mammoth &ldquo;clone&rdquo; using extracted genetic material and a modern elephant to carry the clone to term. Researchers at Harvard have recently announced they have&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.livescience.com/50275-bringing-back-woolly-mammoth-dna.html\" target=\"_blank\">made progress doing the same thing</a>.\r\n\r\nIf (and that is a big if) this creature is ever created, or made \"de-extintct,\" it will have a good home in <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pleistocene_Park\" target=\"_blank\">Pleistocene Park</a>. Pleistocene Park, as close to a &ldquo;real life&rdquo; prehistoric park as can exist, was created in Russia to recreate the entire tundra ecosystem present in that region during the last ice age. So instead of a visit to Jurassic Park, Pleistocene Park will have to do.</p>","description":"The details on the science behind the dinosaurs in the Jurassic Park franchise, including the creation of the new beast Indominus rex","image":"http://blogs-images.forbes.com/shaenamontanari/files/2015/06/2424_AB0220_COMP_053785_1061R.JPG_cmyk-300x169.jpg","type":"blog","storyType":"post","uri":"http://www.forbes.com/sites/shaenamontanari/2015/06/08/its-a-jurassic-world-and-we-are-just-living-in-it-the-cinematic-science-of-dinosaurs/","comments":[],"visible":true,"promotedChannelSections":[{"channel":"channel_3","section":"section_16","title":"What We've Learned About Dinosaurs Since Jurassic Park Came Out","description":"The details on the science behind the dinosaurs in the Jurassic Park franchise, including the creation of the new beast Indominus rex","image":"/images/channels/channel_3_section_16_panel71_0_bigsquare-1433774542.jpg","location":"top"}],"blogId":"3751","authors":[{"naturalId":"blogAuthorId/blog/author/1718528","name":"Shaena Montanari","avatars":[{"size":136,"image":"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/17b035d66b8c1d7ca7234b6144c827c3?s=136&amp;d=http%3A%2F%2F1.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2Fad516503a11cd5ca435acc9bb6523536%3Fs%3D136&amp;r=G"},{"size":40,"image":"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/17b035d66b8c1d7ca7234b6144c827c3?s=40&amp;d=http%3A%2F%2F1.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2Fad516503a11cd5ca435acc9bb6523536%3Fs%3D40&amp;r=G"},{"size":400,"image":"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/17b035d66b8c1d7ca7234b6144c827c3?s=400&amp;d=http%3A%2F%2F1.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2Fad516503a11cd5ca435acc9bb6523536%3Fs%3D400&amp;r=G"},{"size":62,"image":"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/17b035d66b8c1d7ca7234b6144c827c3?s=62&amp;d=http%3A%2F%2F1.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2Fad516503a11cd5ca435acc9bb6523536%3Fs%3D62&amp;r=G"}],"url":"http://www.forbes.com/sites/shaenamontanari/","type":"Contributor","profileUrl":"/sites/shaenamontanari/","twitterName":"DrShaena","authorType":"individual","email":"shae.montanari@gmail.com","blog":false,"numFollowers":0,"shortBio":"I write about paleontology, dinosaurs, and comparative biology.","timestamp":1445787864437,"description":"I am a paleontologist living in the UK as a Newton International Fellow at the University of Edinburgh.

away from the theaterical release of <em>Jurassic World</em>, the fourth installment of the <em>Jurassic Park</em> series, paleontologists and dinosaur lovers alike are eagerly awaiting the return of the most beloved dinosaur franchise in film history.&nbsp;As a professional dinosaur lover, I’ve been having fun revisiting what the scientific community has learned from the fossil record since the first <em>Jurassic Park</em> to see what this new film appears to get right about dinosaurs and where it diverges from the consensus.</p>\n<p>Scientists have known for decades that dinosaurs are related to birds and were most assuredly covered in feathers. Even though dinosaurs were being depicted in illustrations with feathery coatings as early as the late 1970s, it was not until the early 1990s that the mounting comparative anatomical evidence from fossil discoveries elevated the hypothesis of birds being avian dinosaurs to near universal acceptance in the paleontological community.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_155\"> \n <img class=\"size-large wp-image-155\" src=\"http://blogs-images.forbes.com/shaenamontanari/files/2015/06/2424_SB_00033R.JPG_cmyk-1940x968.jpg\" alt=\"CHRIS PRATT stars as Owen in &quot;Jurassic World&quot;.

Although, interestingly, <a href=\"http://rsbl.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/11/6/20150229\" target=\"_blank\">recent research suggest</a>s&nbsp;that the common ancestor of dinosaurs was not feathered and the ‘feathery’ coating seen in ornithischian dinosaurs arose independently from the feathers of theropods.
