\"Entourage,\" HBO Should Make More Movies","date":1433699400000,"timestamp":1433713971669,"body":"<p>HBO's <em>Entourage</em> movie didn't do great at the box office this weekend. The TV spin-off film, <a href=\"http://www.vox.com/2015/6/3/8723545/entourage-movie-why\">which cost</a> a reported $30 million to produce, ranked fourth with a $10.4 million take. That made it the lowest-grossing of three movies that opened this weekend and put it behind disaster flick <em>San Andreas,</em> which is in its second weekend in theaters.\r\n\r\nIt remains to be seen if the Hollywood-insider film about actor Vinnie Chase (played by Adrien Grenier) and his emotionally stunted buddies can turn a profit. Movies usually have to earn at least twice their production budget at the box office in order to make a profit. <em>Entourage</em> may turn out to be a squeaker for HBO's parent company [entity display=\"Time Warner\" type=\"organization\" subtype=\"company\" active=\"true\" activated=\"true\" deactivated=\"false\" key=\"time-warner\" ticker=\"TWX\" exchange=\"NYSE\" natural_id=\"fred/company/4333\"]Time Warner[/entity].\r\n\r\nBut even if it loses a little money, HBO should push harder to get more movies into theaters.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_20399\" align=\"\" width=\"1280\"]<img class=\"size-full wp-image-20399\" src=\"http://blogs-images.forbes.com/dorothypomerantz/files/2015/06/Entourage-4.jpg\" alt=\"Vinnie and the boys are back.\"> Vinnie and the boys are back.[/caption]\r\n\r\nThat's the argument put forward<a href=\"http://seekingalpha.com/article/3233926-dont-stop-at-entourage-hbo\"> by Steven Mallas</a> at Seeking Alpha and I completely agree with him.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, let's acknowledge that HBO is already in the movie business. Films like <em>Behind the Candelabra</em> and <em>Grey Gardens</em> were as good, if not better, than most of what's&nbsp;been in theaters over the past few years. Just because those movies showed on the small screen doesn't make them any smaller in terms of quality and look.\r\n\r\nBut HBO has an even more powerful engine&nbsp;in its original TV shows. Shows like <em>Girls</em>, <em>Curb Your Enthusiasm</em> and <em>Game of Thrones</em> have become part of the cultural zeitgeist. They inspire rabid love from fans and are talked about endlessly online.\r\n\r\nIt won't make sense for every show to become a movie but HBO execs should be thinking about a movie option for every TV show&nbsp;from early on. And the film should be something the network capitalizes on quickly. It took almost five years for <em>Entourage</em> to become a movie. <em>Sex and the City</em> hit the big screen four years after the show ended its run. The two <em>Sex and the City</em> movies earned a total $703 million at the global box office. Imagine how much they would have made if they had come to theaters when the show was still a much bigger part of pop culture.\r\n<!--nextpage-->\r\nMallas argues that HBO should make more movies to help the network in its competition against [entity display=\"Netflix\" type=\"organization\" subtype=\"company\" active=\"true\" activated=\"true\" deactivated=\"false\" key=\"netflix\" ticker=\"NFLX\" exchange=\"NASDAQ\" natural_id=\"fred/company/6132\"]Netflix[/entity], which in now moving into original films. HBO has a huge advantage in its partnership with Warner Bros. studios, which is also owned by Time Warner. If HBO can turn its existing properties into mid-budget movies, it could create a very nice little pipeline for the network. The $30 - $60 million budget category is one that has been almost entirely abandoned by studios. Movies based on popular HBO TV shows could fill that gap.\r\n\r\nEven if the movies don't earn big in theaters, HBO can then keep then as&nbsp;exclusives on HBO. Bringing in new viewers via the theater experience could create new subscribers and subscribers who don't see the films in theaters will have an added incentive to keep paying for HBO because they know they're going to get that exclusive content. That would definitely help HBO stay competitive with Netflix.\r\n\r\nAll of this is, of course, not as easy as it looks. From a business point of view spinning as many TV shows as possible into movies is a great idea. Disney has created an empire by turning everything into a franchise. A movie is hardly worth making at the studio if there isn't the potential for sequels, spin-offs, merchandise and rides. This would essentially be&nbsp;HBO and Warner Bros. cashing in on their own franchises built off of HBO properties.\r\n\r\nBut in reality, turning TV shows into movies can be creatively difficult. TV shows tell stories in very different ways. The first <em>True Detective</em> worked so well because it was able to stretch over eight hours. If creator Nic Pizzolatto had been required to tell the same story in 2 hours, it would have been a very different experience. Regardless, HBO should still try. We could get some great movies out of it.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;</p>","description":"By working with Warner Bros., HBO could create a steady stream of mid-budget films.","image":"http://blogs-images.forbes.com/dorothypomerantz/files/2015/06/Entourage-4.jpg","type":"blog","storyType":"post","uri":"http://www.forbes.com/sites/dorothypomerantz/2015/06/07/despite-weak-box-office-for-entourage-hbo-should-make-more-movies/","comments":[],"visible":true,"promotedChannelSections":[{"channel":"channel_1","section":"","title":"Why HBO Should Turn More TV Shows Into Movies","description":"'Entourage' may have disappointed this weekend at the box office, but the cable channel should be working harder with Warner Bros. to create a steady stream of mid-budget films.","image":"/images/channels/channel_1_panel16_0_bigsquare-1433727214.jpg","location":"top"}],"blogId":"928","authors":[{"naturalId":"blogAuthorId/blog/author/54","name":"Dorothy Pomerantz","avatars":[{"size":136,"image":"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/0e45452c1b29cf6495527fcedb507fd1?s=136&amp;d=http%3A%2F%2F0.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2Fad516503a11cd5ca435acc9bb6523536%3Fs%3D136&amp;r=G"},{"size":40,"image":"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/0e45452c1b29cf6495527fcedb507fd1?s=40&amp;d=http%3A%2F%2F0.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2Fad516503a11cd5ca435acc9bb6523536%3Fs%3D40&amp;r=G"},{"size":400,"image":"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/0e45452c1b29cf6495527fcedb507fd1?s=400&amp;d=http%3A%2F%2F0.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2Fad516503a11cd5ca435acc9bb6523536%3Fs%3D400&amp;r=G"},{"size":62,"image":"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/0e45452c1b29cf6495527fcedb507fd1?s=62&amp;d=http%3A%2F%2F0.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2Fad516503a11cd5ca435acc9bb6523536%3Fs%3D62&amp;r=G"}],"url":"http://www.forbes.com/sites/dorothypomerantz/","type":"Contributor","profileUrl":"/sites/dorothypomerantz/","twitterName":"DorothyPWrites","authorType":"individual","email":"dpomerantz@forbes.com","tagName":"[The Business of Hollwood","blog":false,"numFollowers":0,"shortBio":"I write about the business of Hollywood.","amazon":"http://www.amazon.com/DisneyWar-James-B-Stewart/dp/0743267095/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1313004272&sr=8-1","timestamp":1445791198098,"description":"I live in Los Angeles and I'm lucky enough to write about the thing I love most: movies.

<em>Entourage</em> movie didn’t do great at the box office this weekend. The TV spin-off film, <a href=\"http://www.vox.com/2015/6/3/8723545/entourage-movie-why\">which cost</a> a reported $30 million to produce, ranked fourth with a $10.4 million take. That made it the lowest-grossing of three movies that opened this weekend and put it behind disaster flick <em>San Andreas,</em> which is in its second weekend in theaters.</p>\n<p>It remains to be seen if the Hollywood-insider film about actor Vinnie Chase (played by Adrien Grenier) and his emotionally stunted buddies can turn a profit. Movies usually have to earn at least twice their production budget at the box office in order to make a profit. <em>Entourage</em> may turn out to be a squeaker for HBO’s parent company <span class=\"quotecard\" article-quote-card=\"\" data-ticker=\"TWX\" data-exchange=\"NYSE\" data-type=\"organization\" data-naturalid=\"fred/company/4333\" data-quotes-closing=\"72.53\" data-quotes-now=\"73.27\" data-link=\"/companies/time-warner\" data-name=\"Time Warner\"></span>.</p>\n<p>But even if it loses a little money, HBO should push harder to get more movies into theaters.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_20399\"> \n <img class=\"size-full wp-image-20399\" src=\"http://blogs-images.forbes.com/dorothypomerantz/files/2015/06/Entourage-4.jpg\" alt=\"Vinnie and the boys are back.\" /> \n <p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Vinnie and the boys are back.</p> \n</div>\n<p>That’s the argument put forward<a href=\"http://seekingalpha.com/article/3233926-dont-stop-at-entourage-hbo\"> by Steven Mallas</a> at Seeking Alpha and I completely agree with him.</p>\n<p>First of all, let’s acknowledge that HBO is already in the movie business. Films like <em>Behind the Candelabra</em> and <em>Grey Gardens</em> were as good, if not better, than most of what’s&nbsp;been in theaters over the past few years. Just because those movies showed on the small screen doesn’t make them any smaller in terms of quality and look.</p>\n<div id=\"inread\" article-ad-inbody=\"inread\" class=\"inread\"></div>\n<p>But HBO has an even more powerful engine&nbsp;in its original TV shows. Shows like <em>Girls</em>, <em>Curb Your Enthusiasm</em> and <em>Game of Thrones</em> have become part of the cultural zeitgeist. They inspire rabid love from fans and are talked about endlessly online.</p>\n<p>It won’t make sense for every show to become a movie but HBO execs should be thinking about a movie option for every TV show&nbsp;from early on. And the film should be something the network capitalizes on quickly. It took almost five years for <em>Entourage</em> to become a movie. <em>Sex and the City</em> hit the big screen four years after the show ended its run. The two <em>Sex and the City</em> movies earned a total $703 million at the global box office. Imagine how much they would have made if they had come to theaters when the show was still a much bigger part of pop culture.</p>\n<div class=\"vestpocket\" vest-pocket=\"\"></div>","<p>Mallas argues that HBO should make more movies to help the network in its competition against <span class=\"quotecard\" article-quote-card=\"\" data-ticker=\"NFLX\" data-exchange=\"NASDAQ\" data-type=\"organization\" data-naturalid=\"fred/company/6132\" data-quotes-closing=\"97.28\" data-quotes-now=\"100.021\" data-link=\"/companies/netflix\" data-name=\"Netflix\"></span>, which in now moving into original films. HBO has a huge advantage in its partnership with Warner Bros. studios, which is also owned by Time Warner. If HBO can turn its existing properties into mid-budget movies, it could create a very nice little pipeline for the network. The $30 – $60 million budget category is one that has been almost entirely abandoned by studios. Movies based on popular HBO TV shows could fill that gap.</p>\n<p>Even if the movies don’t earn big in theaters, HBO can then keep then as&nbsp;exclusives on HBO. Bringing in new viewers via the theater experience could create new subscribers and subscribers who don’t see the films in theaters will have an added incentive to keep paying for HBO because they know they’re going to get that exclusive content. That would definitely help HBO stay competitive with Netflix.</p>\n<p>All of this is, of course, not as easy as it looks. From a business point of view spinning as many TV shows as possible into movies is a great idea. Disney has created an empire by turning everything into a franchise. A movie is hardly worth making at the studio if there isn’t the potential for sequels, spin-offs, merchandise and rides. This would essentially be&nbsp;HBO and Warner Bros. cashing in on their own franchises built off of HBO properties.</p>\n<p>But in reality, turning TV shows into movies can be creatively difficult. TV shows tell stories in very different ways. The first <em>True Detective</em> worked so well because it was able to stretch over eight hours. If creator Nic Pizzolatto had been required to tell the same story in 2 hours, it would have been a very different experience. Regardless, HBO should still try. We could get some great movies out of it.</p>\n<div id=\"inread\" article-ad-inbody=\"inread\" class=\"inread\"></div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>"],"disableDigest":false,"writtenByForbesStaff":false,"channelSectionMappings":[{"id":"channel_1","channelName":"Business","url":"/business"},{"id":"channel_1section_191","channelName":"Business","sectionName":"Powering Productivity","url":"/powering-productivity"},{"id":"channel_1section_3","channelName":"Business","sectionName":"Media & Entertainment","url":"/media-entertainment"}],"digestDisabled":false,"brandVoiceTitle":"Despite Weak Box Office For \"Entourage,\" HBO Should Make More Movies","groupAuthor":{"naturalId":"blogAuthorId/blog/author/blog-928","name":"Show Me The Money","avatars":[{"size":0},{"size":0},{"size":0},{"size":0}],"url":"http://www.forbes.com/sites/dorothypomerantz/","profileUrl":"http://blogs.forbes.com/dorothypomerantz/profile/","twitterName":"DorothyAtForbes","authorType":"individual","facebookName":"DorothyPomerantz","tagName":"[The Business of Hollwood","blog":true,"numFollowers":0,"timestamp":1445791002173,"recentFlag":false,"primaryBlogNaturalId":"blogAuthorId/blog/author/blog-928","primaryContributor":"blogAuthorId/blog/author/54","primaryContributorData":{"naturalId":"blogAuthorId/blog/author/54","name":"Dorothy Pomerantz","avatars":[{"size":40,"image":"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/0e45452c1b29cf6495527fcedb507fd1?s=40&amp;d=http%3A%2F%2F0.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2Fad516503a11cd5ca435acc9bb6523536%3Fs%3D40&amp;r=G"},{"size":62,"image":"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/0e45452c1b29cf6495527fcedb507fd1?s=62&amp;d=http%3A%2F%2F0.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2Fad516503a11cd5ca435acc9bb6523536%3Fs%3D62&amp;r=G"},{"size":136,"image":"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/0e45452c1b29cf6495527fcedb507fd1?s=136&amp;d=http%3A%2F%2F0.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2Fad516503a11cd5ca435acc9bb6523536%3Fs%3D136&amp;r=G"},{"size":400,"image":"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/0e45452c1b29cf6495527fcedb507fd1?s=400&amp;d=http%3A%2F%2F0.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2Fad516503a11cd5ca435acc9bb6523536%3Fs%3D400&amp;r=G"}],"blog":false,"numFollowers":0,"shortBio":"I write about the business of Hollywood.","description":"I live in Los Angeles and I'm lucky enough to write about the thing I love most: movies.
