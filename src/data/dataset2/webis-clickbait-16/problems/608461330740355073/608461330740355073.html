Cage And Become Self-Employed","date":1433864460000,"timestamp":1433867716163,"body":"<em><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Screw-Zoo-Escape-From-World/dp/0996154906\">Screw the Zoo</a></em>, written by Sam McRoberts, is a new book on the subject of escaping from the mental and societal cages in which far too many of us seem to be trapped. Sam sent me an advance copy of the book to read, and I read it with fascination as I came to realize the psychology that&rsquo;s required not only to leave one&rsquo;s full-time job, but to be successful in self-employment.\r\n\r\nMcRoberts&rsquo; message within the book is that anyone can make the leap from being employed to self-employment, as long as they have the necessary psychological tools and knowledge. He emphasizes that freedom and happiness are found in self-employment. Each chapter includes lessons of psychology to help overcome challenges, read minds, and predict others&rsquo; thoughts and actions. After reading it, I reached out to schedule an interview with Sam to dive into the process of writing a book, as well as some of the subjects that his book deals with.\r\n\r\n<strong>Jayson DeMers: </strong>What&rsquo;s the significance of the title?\r\n\r\n<strong>Sam McRoberts:</strong> I was pacing around my office, feeling trapped, when I had this strong mental image of a lion pacing around inside of a cage, wishing for the freedom he could see on the other side of the bars.\r\n\r\nI also watched (or maybe re-watched) <em>Madagascar</em> around that time (a movie about a group of animals who escape from the zoo to get back to the wild), and so the mental image of &ldquo;escaping from the zoo&rdquo; was really stuck in my head.\r\n\r\nAnd of course, I wanted a provocative title, something that would catch your eye on a shelf. Nobody had used it, and the domain name and social handles were available. Thus, Screw the Zoo was born.\r\n\r\n<strong></strong><strong>DeMers</strong>: Your book was a fascinating blend of philosophy, psychology, and neuroscience. What led you down those paths?\r\n\r\n<strong>McRoberts</strong>: Like everyone else I know, I was pushed to do well in school, go to college, get a good job, work hard, climb the ladder&hellip;basically, to go down the same path and do the same things that everyone else does.\r\n<!--nextpage-->\r\nI absolutely hated that, and fought tooth and nail to do things my way. I was constantly amazed at how much pushback I got for rocking the boat, and so I&rsquo;ve been hunting for answers ever since.\r\n\r\nPhilosophy, psychology, and neuroscience in particular represent the core bodies of understanding into what it means to be human, and why we do what we do. Really understanding those things is extremely important to me, because I want to live my life deliberately, my way, and not on auto-pilot.\r\n\r\nIf you&rsquo;re looking for a place to start, I&rsquo;ve got a big list of <a href=\"http://screwthezoo.com/extra-reading/\">books that inspired me here</a>.\r\n\r\n<strong></strong><strong>DeMers</strong>: In the book, you say that when you meet someone new, you always ask them &ldquo;What did you want to be when you were a kid?&rdquo; So, what did you want to be?\r\n\r\n<strong>McRoberts</strong>: Oh man, I&rsquo;m not sure I should answer this. If I&rsquo;m being honest, I really wanted to be a professional thief (like, high-end jewels, art, etc.) If you&rsquo;ve ever watched <em>Entrapment</em> or <em>White Collar</em>, those are great representations. It seemed like an epically cool way to become rich, solve impossible puzzles (I love puzzles), and to thumb my nose at &ldquo;the system&rdquo;.\r\n\r\nBut then I watched movies like <em>American History X</em>, <em>Shawshank Redemption</em>, and <em>Lock Up</em>, and decided that prison and I wouldn&rsquo;t get along very well. Thankfully, my life went down a less confined path.\r\n\r\n<strong></strong><strong>DeMers</strong>: What did you actually end up doing?\r\n\r\n<strong>McRoberts</strong>: I sort of fell into online marketing via web design and development. I quickly realized that most companies would only pay $20-$60/hr as an employee, but that I could freelance for $150-$250/hr if I picked a good niche. After getting cut in a large round of layoffs from the company I was working at, I dove into my own business headfirst.\r\n<!--nextpage-->\r\n<strong></strong><strong>DeMers</strong>: What tips would you offer to people who are considering going the self-employed route?\r\n\r\n<strong>McRoberts</strong>: One of the most important things you can do, not just for self-employment, but for a successful life in general, is network. I&rsquo;ve got a whole chapter dedicated to that subject in Screw the Zoo.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the day, the world is composed of people. The more people you know, and the more lives to which you can add value, the more valuable you become. Meet lots of people, and help them in any way you can. The fastest way to break out of your cage is with help from others.\r\n\r\n<strong></strong><strong>DeMers</strong>: If you had to distill the main theme of your book into one key takeaway, what would it be?\r\n\r\n<strong>McRoberts</strong>: I&rsquo;m not sure I could boil it down to just one thing, but the core message is this: Because of the way our brains are wired, and our society is structured, we are literally trapped in dozens of different ways&hellip;most of which we&rsquo;re never consciously aware of.\r\n\r\nWhen you&rsquo;re stuck in a cage that you can&rsquo;t see, and don&rsquo;t understand, how can you possibly escape? We live in a world that&rsquo;s designed for the chunky middle of the bell curve, so to speak. So what are you supposed to do if you&rsquo;re an outlier? What if you aren&rsquo;t, or don&rsquo;t want to be, average?\r\n\r\nThis book is a guide to these hidden cages, and how to escape from them.\r\n\r\n<strong></strong><strong>DeMers</strong>: Any other key takeaways?\r\n\r\n<strong>McRoberts</strong>: One of my favorite quotes comes from Andrew Carnegie, and says &ldquo;Reality is negotiable&rdquo;. There are few more powerful statements that I&rsquo;ve come across. Whatever your life looks like today, whatever you&rsquo;re struggling with, that is only your reality today, not forever. You can change it. Yesterday doesn&rsquo;t have to be tomorrow.","description":"Screw the Zoo, written by Sam McRoberts, is a new book on the subject of escaping from the mental and societal cages in which far too many of us seem to be trapped.

Sam sent me an advance copy of the book to read, and I read it with fascination as I came to realize the psychology that’s required not only to leave one’s full-time job, but to be successful in self-employment.</p>\n<p>McRoberts’ message within the book is that anyone can make the leap from being employed to self-employment, as long as they have the necessary psychological tools and knowledge. He emphasizes that freedom and happiness are found in self-employment. Each chapter includes lessons of psychology to help overcome challenges, read minds, and predict others’ thoughts and actions. After reading it, I reached out to schedule an interview with Sam to dive into the process of writing a book, as well as some of the subjects that his book deals with.</p>\n<p><strong>Jayson DeMers: </strong>What’s the significance of the title?</p>\n<p><strong>Sam McRoberts:</strong> I was pacing around my office, feeling trapped, when I had this strong mental image of a lion pacing around inside of a cage, wishing for the freedom he could see on the other side of the bars.</p>\n<p>I also watched (or maybe re-watched) <em>Madagascar</em> around that time (a movie about a group of animals who escape from the zoo to get back to the wild), and so the mental image of “escaping from the zoo” was really stuck in my head.</p>\n<div id=\"inread\" article-ad-inbody=\"inread\" class=\"inread\"></div>\n<p>And of course, I wanted a provocative title, something that would catch your eye on a shelf. Nobody had used it, and the domain name and social handles were available. Thus, Screw the Zoo was born.</p>\n<p><strong></strong><strong>DeMers</strong>: Your book was a fascinating blend of philosophy, psychology, and neuroscience. What led you down those paths?</p>\n<p><strong>McRoberts</strong>: Like everyone else I know, I was pushed to do well in school, go to college, get a good job, work hard, climb the ladder…basically, to go down the same path and do the same things that everyone else does.</p>\n<div class=\"vestpocket\" vest-pocket=\"\"></div>","<p>I absolutely hated that, and fought tooth and nail to do things my way. I was constantly amazed at how much pushback I got for rocking the boat, and so I’ve been hunting for answers ever since.</p>\n<p>Philosophy, psychology, and neuroscience in particular represent the core bodies of understanding into what it means to be human, and why we do what we do. Really understanding those things is extremely important to me, because I want to live my life deliberately, my way, and not on auto-pilot.</p>\n<p>If you’re looking for a place to start, I’ve got a big list of <a href=\"http://screwthezoo.com/extra-reading/\">books that inspired me here</a>.</p>\n<p><strong></strong><strong>DeMers</strong>: In the book, you say that when you meet someone new, you always ask them “What did you want to be when you were a kid?” So, what did you want to be?</p>\n<p><strong>McRoberts</strong>: Oh man, I’m not sure I should answer this. If I’m being honest, I really wanted to be a professional thief (like, high-end jewels, art, etc.) If you’ve ever watched <em>Entrapment</em> or <em>White Collar</em>, those are great representations. It seemed like an epically cool way to become rich, solve impossible puzzles (I love puzzles), and to thumb my nose at “the system”.</p>\n<div id=\"inread\" article-ad-inbody=\"inread\" class=\"inread\"></div>\n<p>But then I watched movies like <em>American History X</em>, <em>Shawshank Redemption</em>, and <em>Lock Up</em>, and decided that prison and I wouldn’t get along very well. Thankfully, my life went down a less confined path.</p>\n<p><strong></strong><strong>DeMers</strong>: What did you actually end up doing?</p>\n<p><strong>McRoberts</strong>: I sort of fell into online marketing via web design and development. I quickly realized that most companies would only pay $20-$60/hr as an employee, but that I could freelance for $150-$250/hr if I picked a good niche. After getting cut in a large round of layoffs from the company I was working at, I dove into my own business headfirst.</p>\n<div class=\"vestpocket\" vest-pocket=\"\"></div>","<p><strong></strong><strong>DeMers</strong>: What tips would you offer to people who are considering going the self-employed route?</p>\n<p><strong>McRoberts</strong>: One of the most important things you can do, not just for self-employment, but for a successful life in general, is network. I’ve got a whole chapter dedicated to that subject in Screw the Zoo.</p>\n<p>At the end of the day, the world is composed of people. The more people you know, and the more lives to which you can add value, the more valuable you become. Meet lots of people, and help them in any way you can. The fastest way to break out of your cage is with help from others.</p>\n<p><strong></strong><strong>DeMers</strong>: If you had to distill the main theme of your book into one key takeaway, what would it be?</p>\n<p><strong>McRoberts</strong>: I’m not sure I could boil it down to just one thing, but the core message is this: Because of the way our brains are wired, and our society is structured, we are literally trapped in dozens of different ways…most of which we’re never consciously aware of.</p>\n<div id=\"inread\" article-ad-inbody=\"inread\" class=\"inread\"></div>\n<p>When you’re stuck in a cage that you can’t see, and don’t understand, how can you possibly escape? We live in a world that’s designed for the chunky middle of the bell curve, so to speak. So what are you supposed to do if you’re an outlier? What if you aren’t, or don’t want to be, average?</p>\n<p>This book is a guide to these hidden cages, and how to escape from them.</p>\n<p><strong></strong><strong>DeMers</strong>: Any other key takeaways?</p>\n<div class=\"vestpocket\" vest-pocket=\"\"></div>\n<p><strong>McRoberts</strong>: One of my favorite quotes comes from Andrew Carnegie, and says “Reality is negotiable”. There are few more powerful statements that I’ve come across. Whatever your life looks like today, whatever you’re struggling with, that is only your reality today, not forever. You can change it. Yesterday doesn’t have to be tomorrow.</p>"],"disableDigest":false,"writtenByForbesStaff":false,"channelSectionMappings":[{"id":"channel_4","channelName":"Entrepreneurs","url":"/entrepreneurs"},{"id":"channel_4section_124","channelName":"Entrepreneurs","sectionName":"Startups","url":"/startups"},{"id":"channel_4section_143","channelName":"Entrepreneurs","sectionName":"Social Entrepreneurship","url":"/social-entrepreneurship"}],"groupAuthor":{"naturalId":"blogAuthorId/blog/author/blog-2659","avatars":[{"size":0},{"size":0},{"size":0},{"size":0}],"url":"http://www.forbes.com/sites/jaysondemers/","profileUrl":"http://blogs.forbes.com/jaysondemers/profile/","authorType":"individual","blog":true,"numFollowers":0,"timestamp":1445791054482,"specialSlot":"cmo-network-15","primaryBlogNaturalId":"blogAuthorId/blog/author/blog-2659","primaryContributor":"blogAuthorId/blog/author/802825","primaryContributorData":{"naturalId":"blogAuthorId/blog/author/802825","name":"Jayson DeMers","avatars":[{"size":40,"image":"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/4a3f41dd6021427ef69e5256ac303047?s=40&amp;d=http%3A%2F%2F0.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2Fad516503a11cd5ca435acc9bb6523536%3Fs%3D40&amp;r=G"},{"size":62,"image":"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/4a3f41dd6021427ef69e5256ac303047?s=62&amp;d=http%3A%2F%2F0.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2Fad516503a11cd5ca435acc9bb6523536%3Fs%3D62&amp;r=G"},{"size":136,"image":"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/4a3f41dd6021427ef69e5256ac303047?s=136&amp;d=http%3A%2F%2F0.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2Fad516503a11cd5ca435acc9bb6523536%3Fs%3D136&amp;r=G"},{"size":400,"image":"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/4a3f41dd6021427ef69e5256ac303047?s=400&amp;d=http%3A%2F%2F0.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2Fad516503a11cd5ca435acc9bb6523536%3Fs%3D400&amp;r=G"}],"blog":false,"numFollowers":0,"shortBio":"I de-mystify SEO and online marketing for business owners.","description":"I graduated from the University of Washington in 2008 with a degree in Business Administration (Marketing), and immediately entered the professional online marketing world.
