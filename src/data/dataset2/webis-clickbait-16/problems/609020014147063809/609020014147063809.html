When They Squirm?","date":1434022200000,"timestamp":1434525112476,"body":"<p>Worming, squirming, fidgeting, tapping, bouncing&hellip; could these various symptoms of hyperactivity in children with ADHD actually be a way of helping them focus better? That&rsquo;s what the authors of a recent study suggest, and their findings match up with those of a similar study published in April which proposed that &ldquo;sitting still&rdquo; and &ldquo;concentrating&rdquo; don&rsquo;t really go together for those with ADHD.\r\n\r\nThe newest study is small, with 26 preteens and teens diagnosed with ADHD and 18 without the condition. All of the participants, ages 10 to 17, wore a device on their ankles to measure their activity levels while they took a test that assesses their ability to pay close attention to a visual task.\r\n\r\nThe kids with ADHD who moved the most also showed the greatest accuracy in the test. Those without ADHD did not show any different patterns in accuracy based on their movements. The authors of the study, <a href=\"http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09297049.2015.1044511?journalCode=ncny20\">published in the journal <em>Child Neuropsychology</em></a>, suggested that the movement might have contributed to the arousal levels of the preteens and teens with ADHD, thereby helping them concentrate better.\r\n\r\nThe other study, <a href=\"http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10802-015-0011-1\">published in April in the <em>Journal of Abnormal Psychology</em></a>, was similarly small with slightly younger children. Among the 52 children between 8 and 12 years old in the study, 29 had been diagnosed with ADHD while the others had shown normal development. These children underwent a series of memory and concentration tests, such as putting a jumble of numbers and letters in order. Once again, the kids with ADHD that moved the most performed the best. Yet those without ADHD who moved a lot actually did more poorly than the kids without ADHD who moved less.\r\n\r\nFor a long time, most researchers and clinicians dismissed the symptom of hyperactivity as something secondary to a person&rsquo;s impulsivity if they had ADHD. These new studies propose that hyperactivity is a sort of coping or enhancing mechanism or way of helping kids think, but that idea may be a bit overly simplistic, especially since hyperactivity varies so much among children and tends to fade with age, said Dr. Glen Elliott, chief psychiatrist and medical director of Children's <a href='http://www.forbes.com/health/'>Health</a> Council in Palo Alto, California. Since this study can only show an association between two things &ndash;&nbsp;not that one causes or is otherwise directly related to the other &ndash;&nbsp;it&rsquo;s possible there are other explanations for the findings, he said.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_77010ff2653446b682a24d9406a7d706\" align=\"\" width=\"640\"]<img class=\"dam-image ap size-large wp-image-77010ff2653446b682a24d9406a7d706\" src=\"http://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/77010ff2653446b682a24d9406a7d706/640x0.jpg?fit=scale\" alt=\"\"> Students work with Special Olympians at Ready, Set, Gold!

(Photo by Matt Sayles/Invision for Samsung/AP Images)[/caption]\r\n\r\n&ldquo;For example, one might imagine that a child with ADHD who is concentrating especially hard may be less attentive to trying to control bodily movement and therefore become more physically active as a consequence of inattention rather than as an effort to enhance performance,&rdquo; Elliott said.\r\n\r\nIn his clinical practice, Elliott has not found that being hyperactive appears to increase a child&rsquo;s cognitive functioning. At the same time, he pointed out that medication might simultaneously improve a child&rsquo;s concentration while also suppressing their hyperactivity, so it may be difficult to see certain effects. &ldquo;There are classrooms that encourage movement, but it&rsquo;s not clear &ndash;&nbsp;other than helping students be less frustrated &ndash;&nbsp;whether that improves academic performance per se,&rdquo; he said.\r\n\r\nOther clinicians, however, have seen children whose behaviors fit what these studies show, though, again, noticing the correlation does not mean one thing is causing the other.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;It has been my experience that children provided with movement and active exploration generally demonstrate greater cognitive flexibility, creativity and problem-solving processes,&rdquo; said Mayra Mendez, a program coordinator for intellectual and developmental disabilities and mental health services at Providence Saint John&rsquo;s Child and Family Development Center in Santa Monica, California. &ldquo;Children with excessive movement or elevated activity levels generally engage in such activity as a way of seeking out stimulation that activates the brain.&rdquo;\r\n\r\nMendez noted that past research has suggested that movement helps cognitive function because the motion requires quick shifts in attention that enhances cognitive flexibility. Or, more plainly, to move fast, you usually have to think fast too.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;When brain activity is vigorously stimulated through physical actions, the brain reacts with greater thought flexibility and adaptability,&rdquo; Mendez said. &ldquo;When a child with ADHD engages in excessive movement, this may ultimately help the child to focus, retain information and integrate complex concepts.&rdquo;\r\n\r\nThat remains only a possibility, however, not something that research has proven to be the case. Another possibility, she pointed out, is simpler: children with ADHD often have greater sensory processing needs, so the movement may fulfill that need. If you are one of those who absolutely needs to rapidly bounce your leg or else you cannot concentrate, then you have a sense of what this might feel like.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Movement is sensory-based and may serve the child to promote focus, increase alertness and facilitate learning rather than impeding cognitive processing,&rdquo; Mendez said.\r\n\r\nSo what does all this mean? Well, maybe telling your kid with ADHD, or even ADHD symptoms, to sit still and focus is somewhat like telling a person at midnight to lay down, turn out the light, close their eyes and stay awake. One demand may contradict the other for some children. Perhaps the leg-swinging, foot-bouncing, chair-scooting and pencil-tapping are actually integral aspects of their ability to function. Perhaps not &ndash;&nbsp;we don&rsquo;t know yet &ndash;&nbsp;but we know enough to be cautious about demanding that all children sit quietly and learn in the same way.\r\n<!--donotpaginate--></p>","description":"Worming, squirming, fidgeting, tapping, bouncing… could these various symptoms of hyperactivity in children with ADHD actually be a way of helping them focus better?

That’s what the authors of a recent study suggest, and their findings match up with those of a similar study published in April which proposed that “sitting still” and “concentrating” don’t really go together for those with ADHD.</p>\n<p>The newest study is small, with 26 preteens and teens diagnosed with ADHD and 18 without the condition. All of the participants, ages 10 to 17, wore a device on their ankles to measure their activity levels while they took a test that assesses their ability to pay close attention to a visual task.</p>\n<p>The kids with ADHD who moved the most also showed the greatest accuracy in the test. Those without ADHD did not show any different patterns in accuracy based on their movements. The authors of the study, <a href=\"http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09297049.2015.1044511?journalCode=ncny20\">published in the journal <em>Child Neuropsychology</em></a>, suggested that the movement might have contributed to the arousal levels of the preteens and teens with ADHD, thereby helping them concentrate better.</p>\n<p>The other study, <a href=\"http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10802-015-0011-1\">published in April in the <em>Journal of Abnormal Psychology</em></a>, was similarly small with slightly younger children. Among the 52 children between 8 and 12 years old in the study, 29 had been diagnosed with ADHD while the others had shown normal development. These children underwent a series of memory and concentration tests, such as putting a jumble of numbers and letters in order. Once again, the kids with ADHD that moved the most performed the best. Yet those without ADHD who moved a lot actually did more poorly than the kids without ADHD who moved less.</p>\n<div id=\"inread\" article-ad-inbody=\"inread\" class=\"inread\"></div>\n<p>For a long time, most researchers and clinicians dismissed the symptom of hyperactivity as something secondary to a person’s impulsivity if they had ADHD. These new studies propose that hyperactivity is a sort of coping or enhancing mechanism or way of helping kids think, but that idea may be a bit overly simplistic, especially since hyperactivity varies so much among children and tends to fade with age, said Dr. Glen Elliott, chief psychiatrist and medical director of Children’s <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/health/\" target=\"_self\">Health</a> Council in Palo Alto, California. Since this study can only show an association between two things –&nbsp;not that one causes or is otherwise directly related to the other –&nbsp;it’s possible there are other explanations for the findings, he said.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_77010ff2653446b682a24d9406a7d706\"> \n <img class=\"dam-image ap size-large wp-image-77010ff2653446b682a24d9406a7d706\" src=\"http://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/77010ff2653446b682a24d9406a7d706/640x0.jpg?fit=scale\" alt=\"\" /> \n <p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Students work with Special Olympians at Ready, Set, Gold!

At the same time, he pointed out that medication might simultaneously improve a child’s concentration while also suppressing their hyperactivity, so it may be difficult to see certain effects. “There are classrooms that encourage movement, but it’s not clear –&nbsp;other than helping students be less frustrated –&nbsp;whether that improves academic performance per se,” he said.</p>\n<p>Other clinicians, however, have seen children whose behaviors fit what these studies show, though, again, noticing the correlation does not mean one thing is causing the other.</p>\n<p>“It has been my experience that children provided with movement and active exploration generally demonstrate greater cognitive flexibility, creativity and problem-solving processes,” said Mayra Mendez, a program coordinator for intellectual and developmental disabilities and mental health services at Providence Saint John’s Child and Family Development Center in Santa Monica, California. “Children with excessive movement or elevated activity levels generally engage in such activity as a way of seeking out stimulation that activates the brain.”</p>\n<p>Mendez noted that past research has suggested that movement helps cognitive function because the motion requires quick shifts in attention that enhances cognitive flexibility. Or, more plainly, to move fast, you usually have to think fast too.</p>\n<p>“When brain activity is vigorously stimulated through physical actions, the brain reacts with greater thought flexibility and adaptability,” Mendez said. “When a child with ADHD engages in excessive movement, this may ultimately help the child to focus, retain information and integrate complex concepts.”</p>\n<p>That remains only a possibility, however, not something that research has proven to be the case. Another possibility, she pointed out, is simpler: children with ADHD often have greater sensory processing needs, so the movement may fulfill that need. If you are one of those who absolutely needs to rapidly bounce your leg or else you cannot concentrate, then you have a sense of what this might feel like.</p>\n<p>“Movement is sensory-based and may serve the child to promote focus, increase alertness and facilitate learning rather than impeding cognitive processing,” Mendez said.</p>\n<p>So what does all this mean? Well, maybe telling your kid with ADHD, or even ADHD symptoms, to sit still and focus is somewhat like telling a person at midnight to lay down, turn out the light, close their eyes and stay awake. One demand may contradict the other for some children. Perhaps the leg-swinging, foot-bouncing, chair-scooting and pencil-tapping are actually integral aspects of their ability to function. Perhaps not –&nbsp;we don’t know yet –&nbsp;but we know enough to be cautious about demanding that all children sit quietly and learn in the same way.</p>"],"disableDigest":false,"writtenByForbesStaff":false,"channelSectionMappings":[{"id":"channel_1","channelName":"Business","url":"/business"},{"id":"channel_1section_4","channelName":"Business","sectionName":"Pharma & Healthcare","url":"/healthcare"},{"id":"channel_7section_47","channelName":"Lifestyle","sectionName":"Health","url":"/health"}],"brandVoiceTitle":"Might Kids With ADHD Learn Better When They Squirm?","digestDisabled":false,"groupAuthor":{"naturalId":"blogAuthorId/blog/author/blog-3446","avatars":[{"size":0},{"size":0},{"size":0},{"size":0}],"url":"http://www.forbes.com/sites/tarahaelle/","profileUrl":"http://blogs.forbes.com/tarahaelle/profile/","twitterName":"tarahaelle","authorType":"individual","linkedIn":"http://www.linkedin.com/in/thaelle/","blog":true,"numFollowers":0,"timestamp":1445787819727,"primaryBlogNaturalId":"blogAuthorId/blog/author/blog-3446","primaryContributor":"blogAuthorId/blog/author/565880","primaryContributorData":{"naturalId":"blogAuthorId/blog/author/565880","name":"Tara Haelle","avatars":[{"size":40,"image":"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/3dab89cf51a3518fb82fbb23d77736c6?s=40&amp;d=http%3A%2F%2F1.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2Fad516503a11cd5ca435acc9bb6523536%3Fs%3D40&amp;r=G"},{"size":62,"image":"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/3dab89cf51a3518fb82fbb23d77736c6?s=62&amp;d=http%3A%2F%2F1.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2Fad516503a11cd5ca435acc9bb6523536%3Fs%3D62&amp;r=G"},{"size":136,"image":"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/3dab89cf51a3518fb82fbb23d77736c6?s=136&amp;d=http%3A%2F%2F1.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2Fad516503a11cd5ca435acc9bb6523536%3Fs%3D136&amp;r=G"},{"size":400,"image":"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/3dab89cf51a3518fb82fbb23d77736c6?s=400&amp;d=http%3A%2F%2F1.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2Fad516503a11cd5ca435acc9bb6523536%3Fs%3D400&amp;r=G"}],"blog":false,"numFollowers":0,"shortBio":"I offer straight talk on science, medicine, health and vaccines.","description":"I am a freelance science journalist and photojournalist who specializes in reporting on vaccines, pediatric and maternal health, parenting, nutrition, obesity, mental health, medical research, environmental health and the social sciences.

I previously taught high school and often think of my journalism as a form of teaching, by helping others understand science and medical research and by debunking misinformation about vaccines, chemicals and other misunderstood topics.","primaryBlogNaturalId":"blogAuthorId/blog/author/blog-3446","topics":["sports--leisure","lifestyle","health","pharma-and-health","entrepreneurs","drinks","social-impact","healthcare-innovation","forbeswoman","business"],"recentActivityCount":0,"latestActivityDate":1445416140000,"dailyActivityCount":0,"displayChannel":"business","displaySection":"pharma","shortUri":"http://onforb.es/1sBRQhD","slug":"tarahaelle","contributorSince":1350945503000,"showNoVestPocket":false,"embargo":false,"enableContribContact":false,"enableTwitterFeed":false,"forbesTwitterProfile":{"screenName":"tarahaelle","name":"Tara Haelle","profileImageUrl":"http://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/3199346949/cbbb67fc305ba426bca75b7114e8e917.jpeg","description":"science/health journalist • photog • mom • @Forbes • kid lit • scuba • sharks • testprep • #IRPFellow • The Informed Parent (2016) • blog http://t.co/f0MeI3W0dE","createdDate":1224783555000,"location":"Peoria, IL, USA","url":"http://t.co/zIxEFQWZn3","expandedUrl":"http://www.tarahaelle.net","displayUrl":"tarahaelle.net","verified":false},"disableCanonical":false,"disableDigest":false,"largeAvatar":"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/3dab89cf51a3518fb82fbb23d77736c6?s=136&amp;d=http%3A%2F%2F1.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2Fad516503a11cd5ca435acc9bb6523536%3Fs%3D136&amp;r=G","largerAvatar":"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/3dab89cf51a3518fb82fbb23d77736c6?s=400&amp;d=http%3A%2F%2F1.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2Fad516503a11cd5ca435acc9bb6523536%3Fs%3D400&amp;r=G","smallAvatar":"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/3dab89cf51a3518fb82fbb23d77736c6?s=40&amp;d=http%3A%2F%2F1.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2Fad516503a11cd5ca435acc9bb6523536%3Fs%3D40&amp;r=G","largestAvatar":"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/3dab89cf51a3518fb82fbb23d77736c6?s=400&amp;d=http%3A%2F%2F1.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2Fad516503a11cd5ca435acc9bb6523536%3Fs%3D400&amp;r=G","mediumAvatar":"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/3dab89cf51a3518fb82fbb23d77736c6?s=62&amp;d=http%3A%2F%2F1.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2Fad516503a11cd5ca435acc9bb6523536%3Fs%3D62&amp;r=G"}};		} catch(err) {		fbs_settings.content = null;		}</script><script>try {		fbs_settings.ads = {"site":"fdc.forbes","zone":"article-d"};		} catch(err) {		fbs_settings.ads = null;		}</script><script>try {		fbs_settings.promoted_content = {};		} catch(err) {		fbs_settings.promoted_content = null;		}</script><body class="js-contrib" body-scroll="" ng-class="{'csr-body': is_csr}"><script type="text/javascript">if (isIe() && isIe() === 'MSIE') {				document.getElementsByTagName("body")[0].setAttribute('class', 'js-contrib ie');			}</script><!--[if lt IE 7]>		<p class="browsehappy">You are using an <strong>outdated</strong> browser.
