(AP Photo/Amy Lorentzen, File)[/caption]\r\n\r\nMy guess? Most bartering probably skips the IRS, a kind of farmers&rsquo; market don&rsquo;t ask, don&rsquo;t tell.\r\n\r\n<strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Form 1099 Reporting</span></strong>. How will the IRS know about trades or how much cash changes hands? They probably won&rsquo;t unless you receive a&nbsp;<span><a href=\"http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f1099msc.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><span>Form 1099</span></a></span>. According to this&nbsp;<span><a href=\"http://www.irs.gov/newsroom/article/0,,id=106530,00.html\" target=\"_blank\"><span>IRS tax tip</span></a><span>, you should ask the other party for one. Of course, the IRS says you must report any income on your return regardless of whether you receive a Form 1099.&nbsp;</span></span><span>If the barter exchange occurs in employment, there&rsquo;s employment tax on top of income tax. If you&rsquo;re the employer, that can mean a penalty for failure to withhold. What's more, </span><a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/robertwood/2012/03/12/failing-to-pay-employment-taxes-means-personal-liability/\" target=\"_blank\"><span>failing to pay employment taxes means personal liability</span></a><span>.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"text-decoration: underline\"><strong style=\"font-weight: bold\">Cash Reporting</strong></span>.&nbsp;At the farmers&rsquo; market, cash transactions are the norm. Of course, cash is income. However, cash tax forms are rarely required. You must file&nbsp;<span><a href=\"http://www.fincen.gov/forms/files/fin8300_cashover10k.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><span>IRS Form 8300</span></a><span>, if your business receives over $10,000 in cash from one buyer in a single transaction or several related transactions. This is the form that got <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/robertwood/2015/06/10/hastert-pleads-not-guilty-but-can-write-off-blackmail-on-his-taxes/\" target=\"_blank\">Dennis Hastert</a>. $10,000 buys a lot of produce, so you&rsquo;re unlikely to see one.</span></span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"text-decoration: underline\"><strong style=\"font-weight: bold\">Independent Contractors</strong></span>. Whether to hire employees or independent contractors may <em>seem</em> like a no-brainer.&nbsp;With independent contractors, you don&rsquo;t have to withhold taxes or pay benefits, and they are easier to fire.&nbsp;But if your &ldquo;independent contractors&rdquo; are reclassified, the IRS can assess crippling retroactive penalties.\r\n<!--donotpaginate-->\r\nClassically, employees go to work at set hours while independent con&shy;tractors set their own. Employees follow orders, while independent contractors don&rsquo;t. Employees receive regular paychecks while independent contractors are paid by the job. Employees work year-round, while independent contractors are temporary.\r\n\r\nEmployers control employee actions, while independent contractors work on their own. Of course, in real life lines blur and classifications are second-guessed. But many workers who work at the farmers&rsquo; market are probably treated as independent contractors, not employees.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"text-decoration: underline\"><strong style=\"font-weight: bold\">Hobby Losses</strong></span>. A few farmers probably have this issue even though they may think their prize tomatoes are pure business.&nbsp;In this&nbsp;area of intense IRS scrutiny, the IRS <span><a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"http://www.forbes.com/2009/07/10/irs-taxes-hobbies-personal-finance-hobby.html\" target=\"_blank\"><span>issued a new manual</span></a></span>&nbsp;to help IRS agents ferret out taxpayers who improperly write off hobbies. The IRS is less likely to question whether you&rsquo;re engaged in a <em>business </em>where your income exceeds your expenses.\r\n</p><p class=\"next_to_loge\"><span><span><a href=\"http://www.woodllp.com/Publications/Articles/pdf/The_ABCs_of_Hobby_Losses_and_Profit_Motive.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">If you want&nbsp;the ABCs of hobby losses</a>, i</span></span>t helps&nbsp;to&nbsp;keep good records and hold yourself out as running a business.<span><span>&nbsp;If you eke out a profit three years out of five (or two years out of seven if your activity is horse breeding), the IRS will&nbsp;<em>presume</em> you&rsquo;re in business to make a profit. That presumption is worth a lot so you won&rsquo;t have to mud wrestle with the IRS over a fuzzy facts and circumstances test.</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"next_to_loge\"><span><span>There&nbsp;is plenty&nbsp;of good produce at the farmers&rsquo; market.

Most bartering probably skips the IRS, a kind of farmers’ market don’t ask, don’t tell.</p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Form 1099 Reporting</span></strong>. How will the IRS know about trades or how much cash changes hands? They probably won’t unless you receive a&nbsp;<span><a href=\"http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f1099msc.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><span>Form 1099</span></a></span>. According to this&nbsp;<span><a href=\"http://www.irs.gov/newsroom/article/0,,id=106530,00.html\" target=\"_blank\"><span>IRS tax tip</span></a><span>, you should ask the other party for one. Of course, the IRS says you must report any income on your return regardless of whether you receive a Form 1099.&nbsp;</span></span><span>If the barter exchange occurs in employment, there’s employment tax on top of income tax. If you’re the employer, that can mean a penalty for failure to withhold. What’s more, </span><a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/robertwood/2012/03/12/failing-to-pay-employment-taxes-means-personal-liability/\" target=\"_self\"><span>failing to pay employment taxes means personal liability</span></a><span>.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\"><strong style=\"font-weight: bold\">Cash Reporting</strong></span>.&nbsp;At the farmers’ market, cash transactions are the norm. Of course, cash is income. However, cash tax forms are rarely required. You must file&nbsp;<span><a href=\"http://www.fincen.gov/forms/files/fin8300_cashover10k.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><span>IRS Form 8300</span></a><span>, if your business receives over $10,000 in cash from one buyer in a single transaction or several related transactions.

Whether to hire employees or independent contractors may <em>seem</em> like a no-brainer.&nbsp;With independent contractors, you don’t have to withhold taxes or pay benefits, and they are easier to fire.&nbsp;But if your “independent contractors” are reclassified, the IRS can assess crippling retroactive penalties.</p>\n<p>Classically, employees go to work at set hours while independent con&shy;tractors set their own. Employees follow orders, while independent contractors don’t. Employees receive regular paychecks while independent contractors are paid by the job. Employees work year-round, while independent contractors are temporary.</p>\n<p>Employers control employee actions, while independent contractors work on their own. Of course, in real life lines blur and classifications are second-guessed. But many workers who work at the farmers’ market are probably treated as independent contractors, not employees.</p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\"><strong style=\"font-weight: bold\">Hobby Losses</strong></span>. A few farmers probably have this issue even though they may think their prize tomatoes are pure business.&nbsp;In this&nbsp;area of intense IRS scrutiny, the IRS <span><a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"http://www.forbes.com/2009/07/10/irs-taxes-hobbies-personal-finance-hobby.html\" target=\"_self\"><span>issued a new manual</span></a></span>&nbsp;to help IRS agents ferret out taxpayers who improperly write off hobbies. The IRS is less likely to question whether you’re engaged in a <em>business </em>where your income exceeds your expenses.</p>\n<p><span><span><a href=\"http://www.woodllp.com/Publications/Articles/pdf/The_ABCs_of_Hobby_Losses_and_Profit_Motive.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">If you want&nbsp;the ABCs of hobby losses</a>, i</span></span>t helps&nbsp;to&nbsp;keep good records and hold yourself out as running a business.<span><span>&nbsp;If you eke out a profit three years out of five (or two years out of seven if your activity is horse breeding), the IRS will&nbsp;<em>presume</em> you’re in business to make a profit.
