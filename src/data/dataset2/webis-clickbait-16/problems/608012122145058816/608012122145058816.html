2015","date":1433783160000,"timestamp":1444680010961,"body":"<p>When will interest rates increase? The financial press has been hanging on every word of <a href='http://www.forbes.com/profile/janet-yellen/'>Janet Yellen</a> for months, waiting for an indication that the era of ultra low interest rates is coming to an end. Low interest rates are great for borrowers, who can get a 30 year mortgage at <a href=\"http://www.zillow.com/mortgage-rates/\" target=\"_blank\">3.96%</a>, according to Zillow. But those low rates are a real problem for savers, who are stuck with savings accounts paying 0.01% at big banks like <a href=\"https://www.bankofamerica.com/deposits/savings/savings-accounts.go\" target=\"_blank\">Bank of America</a>.\r\n\r\nHowever, a savings account&nbsp;pricing war is being quietly fought online. And MySavingsDirect has just made the next move, increasing the interest rate on their savings account to <a href=\"https://www.mysavingsdirect.com/MySavingsDirectWeb/index.jsp\" target=\"_blank\">1.25%</a>, which is the highest rate I have seen in 2015. MySavingsDirect is part of Emigrant Bank, which was founded in 1850 and has grown to over <a href=\"https://www2.fdic.gov/idasp/confirmation_outside.asp?inCert1=12054\" target=\"_blank\">$6 billion in assets</a>. All deposits with MySavingsDirect are FDIC insured.\r\n\r\nAs I have written <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/nickclements/2015/03/10/how-much-should-you-be-earning-on-your-savings/\" target=\"_blank\">previously</a>, the online savings market is becoming increasingly competitive.&nbsp;And the difference in interest rates is material. If you keep a $25,000 emergency fund at a traditional bank paying 0.01%, you will earn $2.50 of interest over the next 12 months. But, if you put the money at MySavingsDirect, you will earn&nbsp;$314. Everyone should have an emergency fund that is FDIC insured. But no one should have to settle for 0.01%.\r\n\r\n<b>Best Savings Accounts</b>\r\n\r\nThe best internet savings accounts require no minimum deposit, no minimum balance and charge no monthly fees. &nbsp;You can shop for the best savings account interest rates at sites like <a href=\"http://www.bankrate.com/\" target=\"_blank\">BankRate</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.magnifymoney.com/compare/savings-account\" target=\"_blank\">MagnifyMoney</a> (my website) and <a href=\"http://www.nerdwallet.com/rates/savings-account/\" target=\"_blank\">NerdWallet</a>, which update their rates daily. Some of the best rates offered today are:\r\n</p><ul><li>1.25% from <a href=\"https://www.mysavingsdirect.com/MySavingsDirectWeb/index.jsp\" target=\"_blank\">MySavingsDirect</a></li>\r\n\t<li>1.05% from <a href=\"https://www.gecapitalbank.com/savings-products/online-savings.html?prod=SAV\" target=\"_blank\">GE Capital Bank</a></li>\r\n\t<li>1.00% from <a href=\"https://www.banking.barclaysus.com/online-savings.html\" target=\"_blank\">Barclays</a></li>\r\n\t<li>0.99% from <a href=\"https://www.ally.com/bank/online-savings-account/\" target=\"_blank\">Ally Bank</a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\nThe rates I have listed are as of June 8, 2015. At the time of writing this post, all of the banks listed above have no minimum balance requirement and are FDIC insured.\r\n\r\n<strong>Risks Of Online Savings Accounts</strong>\r\n\r\nBefore moving your money to an online savings account, you should understand two key risks. The first is that the interest rate is not guaranteed and can change at any moment. If you want to lock in an interest rate for a fixed period of time, you need to sign up for a Certificate of Deposit (CD). Most of the internet banks offer CDs. It is not likely that these banks will dramatically reduce interest rates, but it is possible. For example, Capital One purchased ING Direct, and renamed it Capital One 360. ING Direct used to be a market leader for interest rates. Capital One 360 is now paying 0.75%, well below the market leaders.\r\n\r\nThe other&nbsp;risk to consider is that it can take a few days for you to receive your money if you need an emergency withdrawal.&nbsp;To open most of these savings accounts, you provide a link to your standard checking account. The Automated Clearing House (ACH) is used to transfer money to and from your checking account. Those transfers can take two to four business days. If you think you could need your money immediately, you should not transfer the funds to an internet savings account.\r\n<!--nextpage-->\r\n<strong>The Battle Will Continue&nbsp;</strong>\r\n\r\nAs interest rates increase, you should expect the battle for deposits to continue, especially online. Putting your money into an internet savings account will never make you rich. However,&nbsp;you don't have to settle for 0.01%. Over the next few years, we can expect life to get better for savers and a little bit more difficult for borrowers.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;","description":"When will interest rates increase?

The financial press has been hanging on every word of <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/profile/janet-yellen/\" target=\"_self\">Janet Yellen</a> for months, waiting for an indication that the era of ultra low interest rates is coming to an end. Low interest rates are great for borrowers, who can get a 30 year mortgage at <a href=\"http://www.zillow.com/mortgage-rates/\" target=\"_blank\">3.96%</a>, according to Zillow. But those low rates are a real problem for savers, who are stuck with savings accounts paying 0.01% at big banks like <a href=\"https://www.bankofamerica.com/deposits/savings/savings-accounts.go\" target=\"_blank\">Bank of America</a>.</p>\n<p>However, a savings account&nbsp;pricing war is being quietly fought online. And MySavingsDirect has just made the next move, increasing the interest rate on their savings account to <a href=\"https://www.mysavingsdirect.com/MySavingsDirectWeb/index.jsp\" target=\"_blank\">1.25%</a>, which is the highest rate I have seen in 2015. MySavingsDirect is part of Emigrant Bank, which was founded in 1850 and has grown to over <a href=\"https://www2.fdic.gov/idasp/confirmation_outside.asp?inCert1=12054\" target=\"_blank\">$6 billion in assets</a>. All deposits with MySavingsDirect are FDIC insured.</p>\n<p>As I have written <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/nickclements/2015/03/10/how-much-should-you-be-earning-on-your-savings/\" target=\"_self\">previously</a>, the online savings market is becoming increasingly competitive.&nbsp;And the difference in interest rates is material. If you keep a $25,000 emergency fund at a traditional bank paying 0.01%, you will earn $2.50 of interest over the next 12 months. But, if you put the money at MySavingsDirect, you will earn&nbsp;$314. Everyone should have an emergency fund that is FDIC insured. But no one should have to settle for 0.01%.</p>\n<p><b>Best Savings Accounts</b></p>\n<p>The best internet savings accounts require no minimum deposit, no minimum balance and charge no monthly fees. &nbsp;You can shop for the best savings account interest rates at sites like <a href=\"http://www.bankrate.com/\" target=\"_blank\">BankRate</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.magnifymoney.com/compare/savings-account\" target=\"_blank\">MagnifyMoney</a> (my website) and <a href=\"http://www.nerdwallet.com/rates/savings-account/\" target=\"_blank\">NerdWallet</a>, which update their rates daily. Some of the best rates offered today are:</p>\n<div id=\"inread\" article-ad-inbody=\"inread\" class=\"inread\"></div>\n<ul> \n <li>1.25% from <a href=\"https://www.mysavingsdirect.com/MySavingsDirectWeb/index.jsp\" target=\"_blank\">MySavingsDirect</a></li> \n <li>1.05% from <a href=\"https://www.gecapitalbank.com/savings-products/online-savings.html?prod=SAV\" target=\"_blank\">GE Capital Bank</a></li> \n <li>1.00% from <a href=\"https://www.banking.barclaysus.com/online-savings.html\" target=\"_blank\">Barclays</a></li> \n <li>0.99% from <a href=\"https://www.ally.com/bank/online-savings-account/\" target=\"_blank\">Ally Bank</a></li> \n <div class=\"vestpocket\" vest-pocket=\"\"></div> \n</ul>\n<p>The rates I have listed are as of June 8, 2015. At the time of writing this post, all of the banks listed above have no minimum balance requirement and are FDIC insured.</p>\n<p><strong>Risks Of Online Savings Accounts</strong></p>\n<p>Before moving your money to an online savings account, you should understand two key risks. The first is that the interest rate is not guaranteed and can change at any moment. If you want to lock in an interest rate for a fixed period of time, you need to sign up for a Certificate of Deposit (CD). Most of the internet banks offer CDs. It is not likely that these banks will dramatically reduce interest rates, but it is possible. For example, Capital One purchased ING Direct, and renamed it Capital One 360. ING Direct used to be a market leader for interest rates. Capital One 360 is now paying 0.75%, well below the market leaders.</p>\n<p>The other&nbsp;risk to consider is that it can take a few days for you to receive your money if you need an emergency withdrawal.&nbsp;To open most of these savings accounts, you provide a link to your standard checking account. The Automated Clearing House (ACH) is used to transfer money to and from your checking account. Those transfers can take two to four business days. If you think you could need your money immediately, you should not transfer the funds to an internet savings account.</p>","<p><strong>The Battle Will Continue&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p>As interest rates increase, you should expect the battle for deposits to continue, especially online. Putting your money into an internet savings account will never make you rich. However,&nbsp;you don’t have to settle for 0.01%. Over the next few years, we can expect life to get better for savers and a little bit more difficult for borrowers.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>"],"disableDigest":false,"writtenByForbesStaff":false,"channelSectionMappings":[{"id":"channel_2","channelName":"Investing","url":"/investing"},{"id":"channel_2section_65","channelName":"Investing","sectionName":"Personal Finance","url":"/finance"}],"digestDisabled":false,"brandVoiceTitle":"The Best Savings Accounts of June 2015","groupAuthor":{"naturalId":"blogAuthorId/blog/author/blog-3618","avatars":[{"size":0},{"size":0},{"size":0},{"size":0}],"url":"http://www.forbes.com/sites/nickclements/","profileUrl":"http://blogs.forbes.com/nickclements/profile/","authorType":"individual","blog":true,"numFollowers":0,"timestamp":1445787828952,"primaryBlogNaturalId":"blogAuthorId/blog/author/blog-3618","primaryContributor":"blogAuthorId/blog/author/1625618","primaryContributorData":{"naturalId":"blogAuthorId/blog/author/1625618","name":"Nick Clements","avatars":[{"size":40,"image":"http://blogs-images.forbes.com/files/2015/03/nickclements_avatar_1425680140-40x40.jpg"},{"size":62,"image":"http://blogs-images.forbes.com/files/2015/03/nickclements_avatar_1425680140-62x62.jpg"},{"size":136,"image":"http://blogs-images.forbes.com/files/2015/03/nickclements_avatar_1425680140-136x136.jpg"},{"size":400,"image":"http://blogs-images.forbes.com/files/2015/03/nickclements_avatar_1425680140-400x400.jpg"}],"blog":false,"numFollowers":0,"shortBio":"I focus on cutting debt, building savings, and banks behaving badly","description":"I spent my career in consumer banking, working for Citibank and Barclays.
