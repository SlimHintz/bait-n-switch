Pressure For Government Regulation","date":1433879760000,"timestamp":1434053880770,"body":"<p>There is a clear link between telecom mergers and the pressure for net neutrality regulation. Large telecom providers usually favor mergers and oppose government regulation. Meanwhile, content providers and consumer groups typically hold opposite views: they oppose the mergers and favor the regulation. Sound policy requires more nuance. The public interest and the long term interests of industry participants are best served by limiting mergers and, as a direct result,&nbsp; minimizing the need for government regulation. Competition, not government regulation, is the best way to ensure that consumers receive what they want at a fair price. But this result is possible only if mergers do not create powerful firms that suppress competition and undermine consumer sovereignty.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_474782120\" align=\"\" width=\"640\"]<img class=\"dam-image getty wp-image-474782120 size-large\" src=\"http://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/474782120/640x0.jpg?fit=scale\" alt=\"\"> Time Warner Cable headquarters in New York City (Photo by Andrew Burton/Getty Images)[/caption]\r\n\r\nIn the aftermath of the Government&rsquo;s thwarting of Comcast&rsquo;s bid to acquire Time Warner Cable, there are three big telecom mergers now in the offing: AT&amp;T&rsquo;s bid to acquire Direct TV, Charter&rsquo;s proposed purchase of Time Warner Cable, and Dish TV&rsquo;s planned acquisition of T-Mobile. This activity occurs against the backdrop of a critical 2011 telecom merger. Comcast successfully closed a deal to purchase NBC Universal, linking a very large video content-provider with the country&rsquo;s largest cable and Internet distributor. The NBC acquisition was problematic for content providers such as Netflix, which had to cut a special deal with Comcast to ensure that customers could get high-speed access to Netflix programming. Concern that Comcast would continue to favor its own content, while discriminating against other programming, explains much of the demand for net neutrality regulation. If all Internet and cable TV distributors were content-neutral, government regulation of net neutrality could be superfluous. Unfortunately, at least two of the pending mergers would further undermine net neutrality. Both Time Warner Cable and Direct TV, for example, control substantial sports programming content. On Charter's board of directors is John Malone who owns the Atlanta Braves and has a significant interest in firms that control programming content, including Liberty Media and Lionsgate. <em>(Note: An earlier version of this article misstated that Charter was under the control of Malone. He and Liberty Media currently own 27% of Charter.)</em>\r\n\r\nThere are other concerns with the pending mergers. Even if distributors are content-neutral, too much power over access limits diversity and makes entry for new programming more difficult. Imagine a world in which all Internet and video programming access is controlled by a single large firm. Leaving aside the monopoly rates that this firm could charge subscribers, a single firm would be in control of all video programming that reaches viewers. Whether it be news, sports or other entertainment, the public is best served by a variety of options that allow consumer choice and foster innovative and diverse programming.<!--donotpaginate-->\r\n\r\nThe pending deals will not result in monopoly control of programming, but they are troubling steps toward less competition, fewer choices, and more dominance by ever-more-powerful distributors over programming content. The more independent distributors that exist, the more dynamism and choice will be preserved in the telecom market place.\r\n\r\nTo be sure, sometimes mergers can end noxious blackouts of popular TV programming. As an example, <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/maurybrown/2015/06/04/dodger-games-finally-coming-to-la-area-charter-subscribers-beginning-tuesday/\">Charter has announced</a> that it will begin carrying the LA Dodger games for the regional market, ending that firm&rsquo;s blackout of the team&rsquo;s televised games. Time Warner Cable owns the long-term rights for Dodger telecasts, so Charter is adopting a position consistent with its future ownership interests. That&rsquo;s welcome news for affected Dodger fans, but not a good sign for the larger group of cable subscribers who do not watch and do not wish to pay for this television coverage. &nbsp;Charter has said that no increased charges will be levied for its subscribers for the short term, but that result is unlikely to hold. Time Warner Cable has demanded roughly $5 a month from distributors and insisted that its channel be bundled in the elephantine package that already costs cable subscribers roughly $100 per month, regardless of whether subscribers are Dodger fans.\r\n\r\nIf the Charter deal is approved, affected Dodger fans may get what they most want, but at what cost? The dysfunctional blackouts that fans have suffered should not be tolerated, but giving in to the increased charges for sports coverage that only a minority of viewers will watch is not an acceptable resolution. Instead, the system must provide all viewers with choices to pay for what they wish to watch.\r\n\r\nThe mergers and the coverage blackouts provide an opportunity to reflect on what a competitively sound telecommunications industry should look like. Fostering and maintaining competition is the key.\r\n\r\nVideo programming, whether through cable or Internet, should offer consumers meaningful choices that allow competition, not regulators, to discipline the market. Three relatively straight forward conditions would protect competition and ensure consumer sovereignty:\r\n\r\n1. Consumers should be able to choose among multiple cable distributors (most consumers have three or four choices, but this competition would be lessened if the AT&amp;T/Direct TV deal were approved) and among multiple high-speed Internet providers (here most consumers lack meaningful choices).\r\n\r\n2. Consumers should have a genuine opportunity to buy content selectively (no one should be forced to purchase giant bundles of unwanted cable channels.\r\n\r\n3. Distributors of video programming should be content-neutral, staying out of the business of profiting from ownership or control of particular content.\r\n\r\nAchieving these conditions is unlikely in the foreseeable future. Content providers continue to insist on oppressive bundles of channels. Comcast, Time Warner Cable and other distributors continue to own substantial video content, and consumers have at most only one or two sources for high speed Internet. Merger and telecommunications policy, however, should be aligned with these long term goals. The proposed Charter and AT&amp;T deals should be prohibited because they are further steps away from competition model and will increase pressure for government regulation. In the meantime, to the extent that government regulation is required, it should make exceptions for distributors that are content-neutral and function in competitive markets.\r\n\r\n<em><strong>Also on Forbes:</strong> </em>\r\n\r\n[gallery2012]\r\n\r\n&nbsp;</p>","description":"BY WARREN GRIMES - Competition, not government regulation, is the best way to ensure that consumers receive what they want at a fair price.","image":"http://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/474782120/640x0.jpg?fit=scale","type":"blogslide","storyType":"post","uri":"http://www.forbes.com/sites/realspin/2015/06/09/more-telecom-mergers-increase-pressure-for-government-regulation/","comments":[],"visible":true,"promotedChannelSections":[{"channel":"channel_5","section":"","title":"Telecom Mergers Increase Regulation Pressure","description":"BY WARREN GRIMES - Competition, not government regulation, is the best way to ensure that consumers receive what they want at a fair price.","image":"http://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/474782120/640x0.jpg?fit=scale","location":"top"},{"channel":"channel_5","section":"section_84","title":"Telecom Mergers Increase Pressure For Regulation","description":"Competition, not government regulation, is the best way to ensure that consumers receive what they want at a fair price.","image":"/images/channels/channel_5_section_84_panel28_0_bigsquare-1434558879.jpg","location":"top"}],"blogId":"1104","authors":[{"naturalId":"blogAuthorId/blog/author/3151","name":"Capital Flows","avatars":[{"size":136,"image":"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/f74a8413e9884df39b508cb219be74bb?s=136&amp;d=http%3A%2F%2F1.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2Fad516503a11cd5ca435acc9bb6523536%3Fs%3D136&amp;r=G"},{"size":40,"image":"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/f74a8413e9884df39b508cb219be74bb?s=40&amp;d=http%3A%2F%2F1.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2Fad516503a11cd5ca435acc9bb6523536%3Fs%3D40&amp;r=G"},{"size":400,"image":"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/f74a8413e9884df39b508cb219be74bb?s=400&amp;d=http%3A%2F%2F1.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2Fad516503a11cd5ca435acc9bb6523536%3Fs%3D400&amp;r=G"},{"size":62,"image":"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/f74a8413e9884df39b508cb219be74bb?s=62&amp;d=http%3A%2F%2F1.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2Fad516503a11cd5ca435acc9bb6523536%3Fs%3D62&amp;r=G"}],"url":"http://www.forbes.com/sites/realspin/","type":"Contributor","profileUrl":"/sites/realspin/","twitterName":"ForbesOpinion","authorType":"individual","email":"opinions@forbes.com","tagName":"Guest commentary curated by Forbes Opinion.","blog":false,"numFollowers":0,"shortBio":"Guest commentary curated by Forbes Opinion.","webSite":"http://www.forbes.com/opinions/","timestamp":1445791233652,"description":"Guest commentary curated by Forbes Opinion.","recentFlag":false,"blogName":"Guest Opinion","primaryBlogNaturalId":"blogAuthorId/blog/author/blog-1104","topics":["oped","entrepreneurs","regulation","fact-and-comment","policy","economics","politics","law","world-affairs","energy--environment","healthcare--fiscal","state--urban","science--technology"],"recentActivityCount":0,"latestActivityDate":1445537760000,"dailyActivityCount":0,"displayChannel":"opinions","displaySection":"realspinblog","shortUri":"http://onforb.es/12liUSf","slug":"realspin","contributorSince":1284422884000,"showNoVestPocket":false,"embargo":false,"enableContribContact":true,"enableTwitterFeed":false,"forbesTwitterProfile":{"screenName":"ForbesOpinion","name":"Forbes Opinion","profileImageUrl":"http://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/421493258829582336/jHw2iSsk.png","description":"Policy, politics, opinion and editorials from @Forbes.

Large telecom providers usually favor mergers and oppose government regulation. Meanwhile, content providers and consumer groups typically hold opposite views: they oppose the mergers and favor the regulation. Sound policy requires more nuance. The public interest and the long term interests of industry participants are best served by limiting mergers and, as a direct result,&nbsp; minimizing the need for government regulation. Competition, not government regulation, is the best way to ensure that consumers receive what they want at a fair price. But this result is possible only if mergers do not create powerful firms that suppress competition and undermine consumer sovereignty.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_474782120\"> \n <img class=\"dam-image getty wp-image-474782120 size-large\" src=\"http://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/474782120/640x0.jpg?fit=scale\" alt=\"\" /> \n <p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Time Warner Cable headquarters in New York City (Photo by Andrew Burton/Getty Images)</p> \n</div>\n<p>In the aftermath of the Government’s thwarting of Comcast’s bid to acquire Time Warner Cable, there are three big telecom mergers now in the offing: AT&amp;T’s bid to acquire Direct TV, Charter’s proposed purchase of Time Warner Cable, and Dish TV’s planned acquisition of T-Mobile. This activity occurs against the backdrop of a critical 2011 telecom merger. Comcast successfully closed a deal to purchase NBC Universal, linking a very large video content-provider with the country’s largest cable and Internet distributor. The NBC acquisition was problematic for content providers such as Netflix, which had to cut a special deal with Comcast to ensure that customers could get high-speed access to Netflix programming. Concern that Comcast would continue to favor its own content, while discriminating against other programming, explains much of the demand for net neutrality regulation. If all Internet and cable TV distributors were content-neutral, government regulation of net neutrality could be superfluous. Unfortunately, at least two of the pending mergers would further undermine net neutrality. Both Time Warner Cable and Direct TV, for example, control substantial sports programming content. On Charter’s board of directors is John Malone who owns the Atlanta Braves and has a significant interest in firms that control programming content, including Liberty Media and Lionsgate. <em>(Note: An earlier version of this article misstated that Charter was under the control of Malone. He and Liberty Media currently own 27% of Charter.)</em></p>\n<p>There are other concerns with the pending mergers. Even if distributors are content-neutral, too much power over access limits diversity and makes entry for new programming more difficult. Imagine a world in which all Internet and video programming access is controlled by a single large firm. Leaving aside the monopoly rates that this firm could charge subscribers, a single firm would be in control of all video programming that reaches viewers. Whether it be news, sports or other entertainment, the public is best served by a variety of options that allow consumer choice and foster innovative and diverse programming.</p>\n<div id=\"inread\" article-ad-inbody=\"inread\" class=\"inread\"></div>\n<p>The pending deals will not result in monopoly control of programming, but they are troubling steps toward less competition, fewer choices, and more dominance by ever-more-powerful distributors over programming content. The more independent distributors that exist, the more dynamism and choice will be preserved in the telecom market place.</p>\n<p>To be sure, sometimes mergers can end noxious blackouts of popular TV programming. As an example, <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/maurybrown/2015/06/04/dodger-games-finally-coming-to-la-area-charter-subscribers-beginning-tuesday/\" target=\"_self\">Charter has announced</a> that it will begin carrying the LA Dodger games for the regional market, ending that firm’s blackout of the team’s televised games. Time Warner Cable owns the long-term rights for Dodger telecasts, so Charter is adopting a position consistent with its future ownership interests. That’s welcome news for affected Dodger fans, but not a good sign for the larger group of cable subscribers who do not watch and do not wish to pay for this television coverage. &nbsp;Charter has said that no increased charges will be levied for its subscribers for the short term, but that result is unlikely to hold. Time Warner Cable has demanded roughly $5 a month from distributors and insisted that its channel be bundled in the elephantine package that already costs cable subscribers roughly $100 per month, regardless of whether subscribers are Dodger fans.</p>\n<div class=\"vestpocket\" vest-pocket=\"\"></div>\n<p>If the Charter deal is approved, affected Dodger fans may get what they most want, but at what cost? The dysfunctional blackouts that fans have suffered should not be tolerated, but giving in to the increased charges for sports coverage that only a minority of viewers will watch is not an acceptable resolution. Instead, the system must provide all viewers with choices to pay for what they wish to watch.</p>\n<p>The mergers and the coverage blackouts provide an opportunity to reflect on what a competitively sound telecommunications industry should look like. Fostering and maintaining competition is the key.</p>\n<p>Video programming, whether through cable or Internet, should offer consumers meaningful choices that allow competition, not regulators, to discipline the market. Three relatively straight forward conditions would protect competition and ensure consumer sovereignty:</p>\n<p>1. Consumers should be able to choose among multiple cable distributors (most consumers have three or four choices, but this competition would be lessened if the AT&amp;T/Direct TV deal were approved) and among multiple high-speed Internet providers (here most consumers lack meaningful choices).</p>\n<p>2. Consumers should have a genuine opportunity to buy content selectively (no one should be forced to purchase giant bundles of unwanted cable channels.</p>\n<p>3. Distributors of video programming should be content-neutral, staying out of the business of profiting from ownership or control of particular content.</p>\n<p>Achieving these conditions is unlikely in the foreseeable future. Content providers continue to insist on oppressive bundles of channels. Comcast, Time Warner Cable and other distributors continue to own substantial video content, and consumers have at most only one or two sources for high speed Internet. Merger and telecommunications policy, however, should be aligned with these long term goals. The proposed Charter and AT&amp;T deals should be prohibited because they are further steps away from competition model and will increase pressure for government regulation. In the meantime, to the extent that government regulation is required, it should make exceptions for distributors that are content-neutral and function in competitive markets.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Also
