Worth The Time?","date":1433363760000,"timestamp":1433512372038,"body":"<p>During his first semester at college, Aidan Martinez made a choice: buy a winter coat or maintain his GPA.\r\n\r\nAs his first Connecticut winter at Wesleyan University approached, the Texas native chose the coat. That fall, Martinez shucked his studying and picked up extra hours at his federal work-study job &ndash; part of his financial aid package &ndash; in order to afford the cost of his cold weather necessities.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;I had to choose between academics and surviving,&rdquo; Martinez, a rising junior, says. &ldquo;So I chose surviving.&rdquo;\r\n\r\nWhile work-study provides many students with the opportunity to afford college and gain working experience, Martinez&rsquo;s situation demonstrates a paradox of the program: while it grants students &ldquo;the college experience,&rdquo; it can also detract from it.\r\n\r\nTo be sure, many work-study positions teach students specialized skills relevant to their future careers. Some of these include working as a research assistant or writing for their university&rsquo;s PR publication. But other positions, such as clerical or dining hall jobs, add less clear value to students&rsquo; lives and career aspirations beyond the monthly&nbsp;paycheck. In fact, students in these positions may have to choose between making the money that has already been factored into their expected financial contribution and engaging in leadership and volunteer roles on campus.\r\n\r\nWesleyan&rsquo;s student government made a move to change this in April. Following concerns over the low minority representation on the Wesleyan Student Assembly and protests claiming it was classist, the organization approved a stipend covering 25 percent of the work-study grant for any participating student &ndash; a platform that won Martinez the vice presidency. The premise: That students with work-study jobs might feel constrained from participating in leadership roles on the WSA.\r\n\r\n<strong>Balancing Objectives</strong>\r\n\r\nVague guidelines leave room for schools to create some low-skill positions for work-study students. According to the Department of Education website for student financial aid, the program &ldquo;emphasizes employment in civic education and work related to your course of study, whenever possible.&rdquo; But while off-campus work-study jobs must be proven to be relevant to students&rsquo; studies, there is no formal approval process for on-campus jobs, says Megan McClean, the managing director of policy and federal relations for the Federal Association of Student Financial Aid Advisors.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;The institution does kind of have discretion over the jobs it creates,&rdquo; she added.\r\n\r\nWhile many work-study jobs are skill-based, McClean says, &ldquo;certainly not all have to be.&rdquo; Work-study need not be about gaining experience or even making money, she added, but can simply help students feel connected to their schools.\r\n\r\nBut others, like Martinez and his classmate Sadasia McCutchen, while grateful for the aid and work opportunities they receive from the program, also see serious flaws.\r\n\r\nMcCutchen, a rising junior who currently works three work-study jobs and serves on her student government, says the program &ldquo;takes away your ability to just be a student.&rdquo; Between the 12-15 hours she works each week for pay, and the five hours a week she works for the Wesleyan Student Assembly for free, McCutchen has at times had to choose going to work over going to office hours for help in a class.\r\n\r\nThe administration was not blind to this. &ldquo;We were getting some anecdotal information that students, particularly first generation students, were working &lsquo;too much&rsquo; and therefore they were not able to participate in other activities,&rdquo; says Antonio Farias, the chief diversity officer at Wesleyan. Administrators will work out logistics of the WSA resolution in the coming weeks, but he said &ldquo;everything&rsquo;s always on the table for us to look at&rdquo; in terms of further reforming work-study.\r\n\r\n<strong>Working Overtime</strong>\r\n\r\nWork-study hours operate more or less on an honor system. According to the Department of Labor, full-time students are not allowed to work more than 20 hours a week while school is in session. But administrators do not directly ensure this happens.\r\n\r\n<!--nextpage-->\r\n\r\n&ldquo;There really is nothing official,&rdquo; says McClean, of the student aid administrator organization. &ldquo;Students are really not supposed to be working more than 20 hours and their supervisor is supposed to be working in tandem with the student to make sure they are working around their class schedule.&rdquo; A Department of Education spokesman wrote in an email that responsibility ultimately falls on the institutions to monitor students&rsquo; hours.\r\n\r\nAlthough students can only be paid the amount allocated to them in their work-study grant, financial pressures &ndash; like Martinez&rsquo;s need for a coat &ndash; could tempt students to take extra hours.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;My freshman year, there was one week I worked 35 hours a week and no one was banging on my door,&rdquo; Martinez says of his work-study jobs. Farias said this case might have been due to human error, adding that when students work additional hours at jobs off campus, the school has no way to regulate their total hours.\r\n\r\nWith such a big time commitment, students tend to look for jobs where they can multi-task. &ldquo;The most sought-after jobs on campus are working at the library so people can do their [home]work while they work,&rdquo; Martinez says.\r\n\r\n<strong>A Dearth of Data</strong>\r\n\r\nResearch into the federal work-study program is sparse. Reid Setzer, a policy and legislative affairs analyst who conducted a one of the few studies on the program for advocacy group Young Invincibles, qualified his findings by saying &ldquo;we don&rsquo;t know a lot.&rdquo; This is because the last time the government published a survey of work-study students was in 2000, with data collected in 1998.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;For whatever reason, people just don&rsquo;t think about it, which maybe is a credit to its existence,&rdquo; says Setzer.\r\n\r\nResearch shows that regardless of the job, working students tend to have better luck in the job market six years after their initial enrollment in college.\r\n\r\nSetzer found work-study students were more likely to earn bachelors&rsquo; degrees and become employed, even though 47 percent of work-study jobs are unrelated to students&rsquo; majors. &ldquo;If you have a job, it&rsquo;s relieving your need to go off-campus for a job,&rdquo; Setzer says. This explains why GPA dips for working students, but less so for work-study students, who tend to have jobs closer to campus and therefore their classes, says Veronica Minaya, a research associate at the Community College Research Center at Teachers&rsquo; College-Columbia University who has studied the program.\r\n<!--nextpage-->\r\n<strong>Imagining a Better Work-Study</strong>\r\n\r\nSetzer recommends the program collect data similar to how students evaluate courses at the end of a semester. This data could be published so prospective students could learn more about the school&rsquo;s aid offerings. &nbsp;The WSA now has a form on its site about the effectiveness and transparency of the work-study program.\r\n\r\nFarias acknowledges, &ldquo;If it sounds like we don&rsquo;t have answers, that&rsquo;s somewhat true,&rdquo; saying the school needs more data to understand the distribution of jobs by demographics.\r\n\r\nSetzer believes there should be a mix in the types of jobs available because, for some, including newer students, just holding a position on campus &ldquo;could be incredibly powerful to keep someone in school.&rdquo;\r\n\r\nMcCutchen acknowledges that many students aren&rsquo;t looking for a life-changing experience in their work-study jobs, but for her, the money is not enough.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Getting paid is obviously the requirement, but I could also choose not to do that,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;We could all choose not to do that and take loans out. I don&rsquo;t want to work and not build a skill set that will be valued in the career world.&rdquo;\r\n\r\nMartinez found that at Wesleyan, administrators contended that &ldquo;work-study adds value.&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Sure, that sounds great in theory,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but when you ask students, those aren&rsquo;t the answers they give you.&rdquo;</p>","description":"Federal Work-Study helps students pay for the college experience, but leaves less time for academics and leadership activities.","type":"blog","storyType":"post","uri":"http://www.forbes.com/sites/laurenfeiner/2015/06/03/the-work-study-dilemma-is-the-money-worth-the-time/","comments":[],"visible":true,"promotedChannelSections":[{"channel":"channel_2","section":"section_65","title":"Work-Study: Is The Money Worth The Time?","description":"Federal Work-Study helps students pay for the college experience, but leaves less time for academics and leadership activities.","location":"top"}],"blogId":"3763","authors":[{"naturalId":"blogAuthorId/blog/author/1726167","name":"Lauren Feiner","avatars":[{"size":136,"image":"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/93657ca44ff804212897c0313c719372?s=136&amp;d=http%3A%2F%2F1.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2Fad516503a11cd5ca435acc9bb6523536%3Fs%3D136&amp;r=G"},{"size":40,"image":"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/93657ca44ff804212897c0313c719372?s=40&amp;d=http%3A%2F%2F1.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2Fad516503a11cd5ca435acc9bb6523536%3Fs%3D40&amp;r=G"},{"size":400,"image":"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/93657ca44ff804212897c0313c719372?s=400&amp;d=http%3A%2F%2F1.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2Fad516503a11cd5ca435acc9bb6523536%3Fs%3D400&amp;r=G"},{"size":62,"image":"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/93657ca44ff804212897c0313c719372?s=62&amp;d=http%3A%2F%2F1.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2Fad516503a11cd5ca435acc9bb6523536%3Fs%3D62&amp;r=G"}],"url":"http://www.forbes.com/sites/laurenfeiner/","type":"Forbes Staff","profileUrl":"/sites/laurenfeiner/","twitterName":"@lauren_feiner","authorType":"individual","email":"lfeiner@forbes.com","blog":false,"numFollowers":0,"shortBio":"I write about how money impacts the college experience.","timestamp":1445787865192,"description":"A native New Yorker, I move at a fast pace and devour news along the way.

his first semester at college, Aidan Martinez made a choice: buy a winter coat or maintain his GPA.</p>\n<p>As his first Connecticut winter at Wesleyan University approached, the Texas native chose the coat. That fall, Martinez shucked his studying and picked up extra hours at his federal work-study job – part of his financial aid package – in order to afford the cost of his cold weather necessities.</p>\n<p>“I had to choose between academics and surviving,” Martinez, a rising junior, says. “So I chose surviving.”</p>\n<p>While work-study provides many students with the opportunity to afford college and gain working experience, Martinez’s situation demonstrates a paradox of the program: while it grants students “the college experience,” it can also detract from it.</p>\n<p>To be sure, many work-study positions teach students specialized skills relevant to their future careers. Some of these include working as a research assistant or writing for their university’s PR publication. But other positions, such as clerical or dining hall jobs, add less clear value to students’ lives and career aspirations beyond the monthly&nbsp;paycheck. In fact, students in these positions may have to choose between making the money that has already been factored into their expected financial contribution and engaging in leadership and volunteer roles on campus.</p>\n<div id=\"inread\" article-ad-inbody=\"inread\" class=\"inread\"></div>\n<p>Wesleyan’s student government made a move to change this in April. Following concerns over the low minority representation on the Wesleyan Student Assembly and protests claiming it was classist, the organization approved a stipend covering 25 percent of the work-study grant for any participating student – a platform that won Martinez the vice presidency. The premise: That students with work-study jobs might feel constrained from participating in leadership roles on the WSA.</p>\n<p><strong>Balancing Objectives</strong></p>\n<p>Vague guidelines leave room for schools to create some low-skill positions for work-study students. According to the Department of Education website for student financial aid, the program “emphasizes employment in civic education and work related to your course of study, whenever possible.” But while off-campus work-study jobs must be proven to be relevant to students’ studies, there is no formal approval process for on-campus jobs, says Megan McClean, the managing director of policy and federal relations for the Federal Association of Student Financial Aid Advisors.</p>\n<div class=\"vestpocket\" vest-pocket=\"\"></div>\n<p>“The institution does kind of have discretion over the jobs it creates,” she added.</p>\n<p>While many work-study jobs are skill-based, McClean says, “certainly not all have to be.” Work-study need not be about gaining experience or even making money, she added, but can simply help students feel connected to their schools.</p>\n<p>But others, like Martinez and his classmate Sadasia McCutchen, while grateful for the aid and work opportunities they receive from the program, also see serious flaws.</p>\n<p>McCutchen, a rising junior who currently works three work-study jobs and serves on her student government, says the program “takes away your ability to just be a student.” Between the 12-15 hours she works each week for pay, and the five hours a week she works for the Wesleyan Student Assembly for free, McCutchen has at times had to choose going to work over going to office hours for help in a class.</p>\n<p>The administration was not blind to this. “We were getting some anecdotal information that students, particularly first generation students, were working ‘too much’ and therefore they were not able to participate in other activities,” says Antonio Farias, the chief diversity officer at Wesleyan. Administrators will work out logistics of the WSA resolution in the coming weeks, but he said “everything’s always on the table for us to look at” in terms of further reforming work-study.</p>\n<p><strong>Working Overtime</strong></p>\n<p>Work-study hours operate more or less on an honor system. According to the Department of Labor, full-time students are not allowed to work more than 20 hours a week while school is in session. But administrators do not directly ensure this happens.</p>","<p>“There really is nothing official,” says McClean, of the student aid administrator organization. “Students are really not supposed to be working more than 20 hours and their supervisor is supposed to be working in tandem with the student to make sure they are working around their class schedule.” A Department of Education spokesman wrote in an email that responsibility ultimately falls on the institutions to monitor students’ hours.</p>\n<p>Although students can only be paid the amount allocated to them in their work-study grant, financial pressures – like Martinez’s need for a coat – could tempt students to take extra hours.</p>\n<p>“My freshman year, there was one week I worked 35 hours a week and no one was banging on my door,” Martinez says of his work-study jobs. Farias said this case might have been due to human error, adding that when students work additional hours at jobs off campus, the school has no way to regulate their total hours.</p>\n<div id=\"inread\" article-ad-inbody=\"inread\" class=\"inread\"></div>\n<p>With such a big time commitment, students tend to look for jobs where they can multi-task. “The most sought-after jobs on campus are working at the library so people can do their [home]work while they work,” Martinez says.</p>\n<p><strong>A Dearth of Data</strong></p>\n<p>Research into the federal work-study program is sparse. Reid Setzer, a policy and legislative affairs analyst who conducted a one of the few studies on the program for advocacy group Young Invincibles, qualified his findings by saying “we don’t know a lot.” This is because the last time the government published a survey of work-study students was in 2000, with data collected in 1998.</p>\n<div class=\"vestpocket\" vest-pocket=\"\"></div>\n<p>“For whatever reason, people just don’t think about it, which maybe is a credit to its existence,” says Setzer.</p>\n<p>Research shows that regardless of the job, working students tend to have better luck in the job market six years after their initial enrollment in college.</p>\n<p>Setzer found work-study students were more likely to earn bachelors’ degrees and become employed, even though 47 percent of work-study jobs are unrelated to students’ majors. “If you have a job, it’s relieving your need to go off-campus for a job,” Setzer says. This explains why GPA dips for working students, but less so for work-study students, who tend to have jobs closer to campus and therefore their classes, says Veronica Minaya, a research associate at the Community College Research Center at Teachers’ College-Columbia University who has studied the program.</p>","<p><strong>Imagining a Better Work-Study</strong></p>\n<p>Setzer recommends the program collect data similar to how students evaluate courses at the end of a semester. This data could be published so prospective students could learn more about the school’s aid offerings. &nbsp;The WSA now has a form on its site about the effectiveness and transparency of the work-study program.</p>\n<p>Farias acknowledges, “If it sounds like we don’t have answers, that’s somewhat true,” saying the school needs more data to understand the distribution of jobs by demographics.</p>\n<p>Setzer believes there should be a mix in the types of jobs available because, for some, including newer students, just holding a position on campus “could be incredibly powerful to keep someone in school.”</p>\n<div id=\"inread\" article-ad-inbody=\"inread\" class=\"inread\"></div>\n<p>McCutchen acknowledges that many students aren’t looking for a life-changing experience in their work-study jobs, but for her, the money is not enough.</p>\n<p>“Getting paid is obviously the requirement, but I could also choose not to do that,” she says. “We could all choose not to do that and take loans out. I don’t want to work and not build a skill set that will be valued in the career world.”</p>\n<p>Martinez found that at Wesleyan, administrators contended that “work-study adds value.”</p>\n<p>“Sure, that sounds great in theory,” he said, “but when you ask students, those aren’t the answers they give you.”</p>"],"disableDigest":false,"writtenByForbesStaff":true,"channelSectionMappings":[{"id":"channel_2","channelName":"Investing","url":"/investing"},{"id":"channel_2section_65","channelName":"Investing","sectionName":"Personal Finance","url":"/finance"},{"id":"channel_6","channelName":"Leadership","url":"/leadership"},{"id":"channel_6section_280","channelName":"Leadership","sectionName":"Win At Work","url":"/ebooks/win-at-work/"},{"id":"channel_6section_37","channelName":"Leadership","sectionName":"Careers","url":"/careers"},{"id":"channel_6section_92","channelName":"Leadership","sectionName":"Education","url":"/education"}],"brandVoiceTitle":"The Work-Study Dilemma: Is The Money Worth The Time?","digestDisabled":false,"groupAuthor":{"naturalId":"blogAuthorId/blog/author/blog-3763","name":"Lauren Feiner","avatars":[{"size":0},{"size":0},{"size":0},{"size":0}],"url":"http://www.forbes.com/sites/laurenfeiner/","profileUrl":"http://blogs.forbes.com/laurenfeiner/profile/","authorType":"individual","blog":true,"numFollowers":0,"timestamp":1445791436909,"primaryBlogNaturalId":"blogAuthorId/blog/author/blog-3763","primaryContributor":"blogAuthorId/blog/author/1726167","primaryContributorData":{"naturalId":"blogAuthorId/blog/author/1726167","name":"Lauren Feiner","avatars":[{"size":40,"image":"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/93657ca44ff804212897c0313c719372?s=40&amp;d=http%3A%2F%2F1.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2Fad516503a11cd5ca435acc9bb6523536%3Fs%3D40&amp;r=G"},{"size":62,"image":"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/93657ca44ff804212897c0313c719372?s=62&amp;d=http%3A%2F%2F1.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2Fad516503a11cd5ca435acc9bb6523536%3Fs%3D62&amp;r=G"},{"size":136,"image":"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/93657ca44ff804212897c0313c719372?s=136&amp;d=http%3A%2F%2F1.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2Fad516503a11cd5ca435acc9bb6523536%3Fs%3D136&amp;r=G"},{"size":400,"image":"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/93657ca44ff804212897c0313c719372?s=400&amp;d=http%3A%2F%2F1.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2Fad516503a11cd5ca435acc9bb6523536%3Fs%3D400&amp;r=G"}],"blog":false,"numFollowers":0,"shortBio":"I write about how money impacts the college experience.","description":"A native New Yorker, I move at a fast pace and devour news along the way.
