Businesses","date":1431360120000,"timestamp":1437417158762,"body":"<p>\"Hi, my name's Jayne and I'm a 4G,\" said a coiffed blonde to a&nbsp;conference room full&nbsp;of women gathered at&nbsp;KPMG's Park Avenue building in New York last week&nbsp;for&nbsp;what could&nbsp;been mistaken for a corporate&nbsp;support group. Some version&nbsp;of \"4G\" --&nbsp;shorthand for \"fourth generation\" -- was&nbsp;offered&nbsp;with every handshake at the Women Corporate Directors' 2015 <a href='http://www.forbes.com/family-business/'>Family Business</a> Governance Institute.\r\n\r\nWhat started off as a conversation about being women on male-dominated boards&nbsp;(one common frustration involved&nbsp;not being heard and having ideas co-opted by male board members) quickly evolved to family-focused issues.\r\n\r\nA special guest, billionaire <a href='http://www.forbes.com/profile/marilyn-carlson-nelson/'>Marilyn Carlson Nelson</a>, former CEO and co-chairman of&nbsp;[entity display=\"Carlson\" type=\"organization\" subtype=\"company\" active=\"true\" key=\"carlson\" natural_id=\"fred/company/12165\"]Carlson[/entity] Inc., a $35 billion (revenues) family-owned travel and hospitality company started by her father in 1938, addressed the group midway through the day. Nelson recounted&nbsp;how her father \"was absolutely crushed\" that he&nbsp;had two daughters and no male heirs. Still, he taught her lessons in leadership when she was a young girl, one of them as she struggled with Sunday School: \"if you don't like it, fix it.\" Nelson's father led the company until he was 84. Nelson said that when she joined the company she vowed to have a clear succession plan, so agreed to stay on for 10 years -- \"enough time to build a culture.\" Nelson was applauded by the women who'd flown in from Italy, Turkey, Israel and all over the US to participate in the conference.\r\n\r\nSuccession planning was a common concern&nbsp;among the women, all hyper-sensitive to how thorny the \"family\" aspect&nbsp;of being in a family business can be. Indeed, Leo Tolstoy's famous observation was invoked by a panelist early on in the morning: \"All happy families are alike; each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way.\"\r\n</p><div style=\"padding: 20px 0pt; margin: 20px 0pt; border-bottom: 1px solid #DDDDDD; border-top: 1px solid #DDDDDD;\"><a style=\"text-decoration: none; color: #900; font: bold 20px/26px Georgia;\" href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Americas-Richest-Families-Compendium-Stories-ebook/dp/B010P9PFAU/?utm_source=article&amp;utm_medium=direct&amp;utm_campaign=richestfamiliesebook\">America&rsquo;s Richest Families: An eBook From Forbes</a>\r\n<a style=\"text-decoration: none; font: 15px/18px  Georgia; color: #000;\" href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Americas-Richest-Families-Compendium-Stories-ebook/dp/B010P9PFAU/?utm_source=article&amp;utm_medium=direct&amp;utm_campaign=richestfamiliesebook\">A glimpse into the lives of the richest, most prolific families in America, and how they built&mdash;and sustained&mdash;their empires.</a></div>\r\nJayne Millard, the \"4G\" chief executive officer of Turtle &amp; Hughes, an electrical and industrial distributor, said later over the phone that she's the only family member now actively involved in her company. \"It hasn't always been that way -- I enjoy the no-drama office now.\"\r\n\r\nPart of the reason Millard traveled from Connecticut&nbsp;to join the conference was to get guidance&nbsp;on&nbsp;how to involve her family's&nbsp;next generation, currently college-age kids, in the <a href='http://www.forbes.com/business/'>business</a> without getting sucked into a counselor role.\r\n\r\n\"We're building a company to last through multi-generations and my credo has always been raise your kids to develop their own passions and interests and along the way if they decide they want to get involved in the business, engage them,\" said Millard.\r\n\r\nMillard herself always&nbsp;knew she'd be involved in the business. After earning her MBA and spending 12 years&nbsp;as a marketing consultant for choreographer Martha Graham, she joined the family company in 1999. She is the third woman in her family to run Turtle &amp; Hughes.&nbsp;Her&nbsp;great-grandfather started the business as a small electrical shop in a Manhattan warehouse in&nbsp;1923 but her&nbsp;great-grandmother ran it after&nbsp;his death from 1942 until 1963, when her mother took over. Since Millard joined the company, she said revenues have grown from&nbsp;$90 million to&nbsp;$550 million in 2014.\r\n<!--nextpage-->\r\nThe consensus among the women offering advice was for her to find a facilitator so she can stay engaged, but from a distance, which Millard says she plans to do. Before the conference adjourned for the day&nbsp;Susan Schiffer Stautberg, co-founder of Women Corporate Directors, warned Millard she'd get more referrals than she'd know what to do with.\r\n\r\nThroughout the day, discussions ran the gamut from the importance of getting women on the board (\"one woman is a token, two women isn't much better, three is the sweet spot\"), and how essential it is to have outside facilitators on the board (\"families are messy and dysfunctional, we have a responsibility to get professionals to lead the business\").\r\n\r\nFor her part, Millard says she has it&nbsp;covered.&nbsp;She's now armed with potential facilitators to contact for the job. Her family board includes four men and four women. Then there's her oldest daughter, who is graduating college this year. She's interested in getting into entertainment but studied business, too. Most importantly, says Millard, she understands the family business and comes to one board meeting a year.\r\n\r\n\"We all have to have succession plans,\" says Millard. \"She's mine.\"","description":"What started off as a conversation about being women on male-dominated boards quickly evolved to family-focused issues and succession planning.","image":"http://blogs-images.forbes.com/kerenblankfeld/files/2015/05/marilyn-e1431373526804-500x283.jpg","type":"blog","storyType":"post","uri":"http://www.forbes.com/sites/kerenblankfeld/2015/05/11/women-on-boards-of-family-business/","comments":[],"visible":true,"blogId":"913","authors":[{"naturalId":"blogAuthorId/blog/author/58","name":"Keren Blankfeld","avatars":[{"size":136,"image":"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/3ed1adfe166c6ee7d4461e70a8b3a2d1?s=136&amp;d=http%3A%2F%2F1.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2Fad516503a11cd5ca435acc9bb6523536%3Fs%3D136&amp;r=G"},{"size":40,"image":"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/3ed1adfe166c6ee7d4461e70a8b3a2d1?s=40&amp;d=http%3A%2F%2F1.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2Fad516503a11cd5ca435acc9bb6523536%3Fs%3D40&amp;r=G"},{"size":400,"image":"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/3ed1adfe166c6ee7d4461e70a8b3a2d1?s=400&amp;d=http%3A%2F%2F1.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2Fad516503a11cd5ca435acc9bb6523536%3Fs%3D400&amp;r=G"},{"size":62,"image":"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/3ed1adfe166c6ee7d4461e70a8b3a2d1?s=62&amp;d=http%3A%2F%2F1.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2Fad516503a11cd5ca435acc9bb6523536%3Fs%3D62&amp;r=G"}],"url":"http://www.forbes.com/sites/kerenblankfeld/","type":"Forbes Staff","profileUrl":"/sites/kerenblankfeld/","twitterName":"@kblankfeld","authorType":"individual","linkedIn":"http://www.linkedin.com/in/kblankfeld","email":"kblankfeld@forbes.com","blog":false,"numFollowers":0,"shortBio":"I cover wealth and dabble in art.","timestamp":1445787595409,"description":"I'm deputy editor of the Forbes wealth team responsible for our signature Forbes 400 and World Billionaires Lists.

Nelson recounted&nbsp;how her father “was absolutely crushed” that he&nbsp;had two daughters and no male heirs. Still, he taught her lessons in leadership when she was a young girl, one of them as she struggled with Sunday School: “if you don’t like it, fix it.” Nelson’s father led the company until he was 84. Nelson said that when she joined the company she vowed to have a clear succession plan, so agreed to stay on for 10 years — “enough time to build a culture.” Nelson was applauded by the women who’d flown in from Italy, Turkey, Israel and all over the US to participate in the conference.</p>\n<p>Succession planning was a common concern&nbsp;among the women, all hyper-sensitive to how thorny the “family” aspect&nbsp;of being in a family business can be. Indeed, Leo Tolstoy’s famous observation was invoked by a panelist early on in the morning: “All happy families are alike; each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way.”</p>\n<div id=\"inread\" article-ad-inbody=\"inread\" class=\"inread\"></div>\n<div style=\"padding: 20px 0pt; margin: 20px 0pt; border-bottom: 1px solid #DDDDDD; border-top: 1px solid #DDDDDD;\"> \n <a style=\"text-decoration: none; color: #900; font: bold 20px/26px Georgia;\" href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Americas-Richest-Families-Compendium-Stories-ebook/dp/B010P9PFAU/?utm_source=article&amp;utm_medium=direct&amp;utm_campaign=richestfamiliesebook\">America’s Richest Families: An eBook From Forbes</a> \n <br /> \n <a style=\"text-decoration: none; font: 15px/18px  Georgia; color: #000;\" href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Americas-Richest-Families-Compendium-Stories-ebook/dp/B010P9PFAU/?utm_source=article&amp;utm_medium=direct&amp;utm_campaign=richestfamiliesebook\">A glimpse into the lives of the richest, most prolific families in America, and how they built—and sustained—their empires.</a> \n</div>\n<p>Jayne Millard, the “4G” chief executive officer of Turtle &amp; Hughes, an electrical and industrial distributor, said later over the phone that she’s the only family member now actively involved in her company. “It hasn’t always been that way — I enjoy the no-drama office now.”</p>\n<div class=\"vestpocket\" vest-pocket=\"\"></div>\n<p>Part of the reason Millard traveled from Connecticut&nbsp;to join the conference was to get guidance&nbsp;on&nbsp;how to involve her family’s&nbsp;next generation, currently college-age kids, in the <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/business/\" target=\"_self\">business</a> without getting sucked into a counselor role.</p>\n<p>“We’re building a company to last through multi-generations and my credo has always been raise your kids to develop their own passions and interests and along the way if they decide they want to get involved in the business, engage them,” said Millard.</p>\n<p>Millard herself always&nbsp;knew she’d be involved in the business. After earning her MBA and spending 12 years&nbsp;as a marketing consultant for choreographer Martha Graham, she joined the family company in 1999. She is the third woman in her family to run Turtle &amp; Hughes.&nbsp;Her&nbsp;great-grandfather started the business as a small electrical shop in a Manhattan warehouse in&nbsp;1923 but her&nbsp;great-grandmother ran it after&nbsp;his death from 1942 until 1963, when her mother took over. Since Millard joined the company, she said revenues have grown from&nbsp;$90 million to&nbsp;$550 million in 2014.</p>","<p>The consensus among the women offering advice was for her to find a facilitator so she can stay engaged, but from a distance, which Millard says she plans to do. Before the conference adjourned for the day&nbsp;Susan Schiffer Stautberg, co-founder of Women Corporate Directors, warned Millard she’d get more referrals than she’d know what to do with.</p>\n<p>Throughout the day, discussions ran the gamut from the importance of getting women on the board (“one woman is a token, two women isn’t much better, three is the sweet spot”), and how essential it is to have outside facilitators on the board (“families are messy and dysfunctional, we have a responsibility to get professionals to lead the business”).</p>\n<p>For her part, Millard says she has it&nbsp;covered.&nbsp;She’s now armed with potential facilitators to contact for the job. Her family board includes four men and four women. Then there’s her oldest daughter, who is graduating college this year. She’s interested in getting into entertainment but studied business, too. Most importantly, says Millard, she understands the family business and comes to one board meeting a year.</p>\n<p>“We all have to have succession plans,” says Millard. “She’s mine.”</p>"],"disableDigest":false,"writtenByForbesStaff":true,"channelSectionMappings":[{"id":"channel_1","channelName":"Business","url":"/business"},{"id":"channel_8section_333","channelName":"Lists","sectionName":"America's Richest Families","url":"/ebooks/americas-richest-families/"},{"id":"channel_8section_54","channelName":"Lists","sectionName":"The World's Billionaires","url":"http://www.forbes.com/billionaires"}],"brandVoiceTitle":"Women on Boards of Family Businesses","images":{"featured":{"url":"http://blogs-images.forbes.com/kerenblankfeld/files/2015/05/marilyn-e1431373526804-1940x1090.jpg","width":1940,"height":1090,"title":"FRANCE-ECONOMY-FORUM-CARLSON","caption":"Billionaire Marilyn Carlson Nelson recounted how her father 'was absolutely crushed' that he had two daughters and no male heirs.
