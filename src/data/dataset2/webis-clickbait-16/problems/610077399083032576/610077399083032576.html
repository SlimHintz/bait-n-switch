The difference between climate changes that are taking place in our present century and those at the dawn of human existence is that humanity now is affecting and instigating such changes. \nWe are constructing our world to such an extent that we have lost sight of both our origins and our futures, caught up in the micro and macro politics of the everyday, feasting on the products of our own creations.\nIt is against the backdrop of the Anthropocene that Pope Francis' upcoming encyclical will be delivered on June 18. In it, the Pope will draw on the praise poem Canticle of the Creatures, which was first penned by the patron saint of ecologists, Saint Francis of Assisi.\nSee also: NASA released a ton of data to help developing nations prepare for global warming\nPope Francis will speak to the ambiguous loss in Western societies of knowing ourselves as creatures. The world that we inhabit may be dominated by human activity, but it is still God\u2019s world first and foremost. Once we know that the Earth is a gift, this creates a different relationship with it compared with the Earth as material for our use.\n\nPope Francis exchanges his skull cap with one donated to him by a child as he leaves at the end of his weekly general audience in St. Peter's Square at the Vatican, Wednesday, June 10, 2015.Image: Alessandra Tarantino)/Associated PressBut he will not romanticize the Earth. Instead, he will speak of the need for human responsibility. And there are likely to be three facets of that responsibility to act, especially on the part of richer, consumer-driven nations of the world.\n\nFirst, on behalf of the poor. \nSecond, in building relationships of peace.\nThird, in service to creation.\n\nThe Earthly world is indeed our home but we have become estranged from it through our practices of domination.\nPope Francis has spent much of his early working life in Latin America. There is no doubt on the part of those suffering the impacts of climate change that it is real; including in some cases severe health effects or even the complete loss of livelihoods.\nSpeak to farmers in rural Kenya, those suffering the impacts of floods in Bangledesh, Pacific island communities that are literally disappearing. All such communities will be watching in anticipation what the most powerful nations of the world will decide to do in Paris at the climate summit meeting in December.\nYet is it always hard for them to find voices that will authentically represent their interests. Pope Francis will attempt to do just that; to speak in solidarity with and on behalf of those who are the most disadvantaged. And that will include especially those who are suffering as a result of environmental injustice, including climate change.\n\nGlobal annual average temperature has increased by more than 1.5 degrees Fahrenheit. The black line shows atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration in parts per million (ppm).Image:  National Climate AssessmentSometimes advocates of climate change forget the myriad other environmental issues. No scientist will challenge the extinction of species, accelerating through human activity at an even greater rate than the human ability to record the changes. But alongside such changes, it is important to note some instances of recovery and the resilience of some creatures over others in the face of extreme change.\nThis resilience or adaptation is an important lesson that human beings are going to have to face in the coming millennia. Paying careful attention to these creatures and acknowledging human entanglement with them is the particular vocation of the ecologist and anthropologist.\nThis may be one reason why Pope John Paul II spoke of human ecology, the integrated and integral understanding of the human person in relation to our natural environment. City living has removed humanity from this sense of being part of the natural world, but it would be a barren city indeed if there were no trees, no birds and no urban wildlife.\nIt is therefore possible to pay attention to species other than humans; it is just harder and less intuitive to do so.\n\nGiant machines dig for brown coal at the open-cast mining Garzweiler in front of a smoking power plant near the city of Grevenbroich in western Germany in April 2014.Image: Martin Meissner/Associated PressPope Francis will draw on the legacy of his predecessor and affirm the integral worth of human beings within the natural world.\nA Christian perspective will not just be content to observe such changes, but will insist that another world is possible, one that hopes for a transformation of this world, and not just escape into the next. Pope John Paul II spoke of this in terms of ecological conversion. Pope Francis may use that language as well, but it is the particular human responsibility to act for explicitly moral and religious reasons that will become especially transparent.\nCaring for the Earth is not an optional extra for the faithful Christian. It is part of what it means to be human.\nAnd the inspiration for that action will come from witnessing the manner of Pope Francis' call to act: a call of the heart and not just the head.\nWhy is it that climate science uses the quasi-religious language of belief and denial when most scientific evidence is worked out on the basis of probability and evidence? Is it because at the heart of the climate science debate there is a deeply held conviction that our natural environment is integral to our own sense of identity? \nIf so, that could be thought of as a secularized account of the Christian belief in creation. \nClimate change denial or advocacy is not really the issue. What is at stake is a change of heart: a heart that will respond with compassion to the needs of those that are poor and the fragile Earth in which all of humanity now finds it's dwelling.\nCelia Deane-Drummond is the inaugural director of the Center for Theology, Science and Human Flourishing, and is professor in theology at the University of Notre Dame.

No scientist will challenge the extinction of species, accelerating through human activity at an even greater rate than the human ability to record the changes. But alongside such changes, it is important to note some instances of recovery and the resilience of some creatures over others in the face of extreme change.</p><p>This resilience or adaptation is an important lesson that human beings are going to have to face in the coming millennia. Paying careful attention to these creatures and acknowledging human entanglement with them is the particular vocation of the ecologist and anthropologist.</p><p>This may be one reason why Pope John Paul II spoke of human ecology, the integrated and integral understanding of the human person in relation to our natural environment. City living has removed humanity from this sense of being part of the natural world, but it would be a barren city indeed if there were no trees, no birds and no urban wildlife.</p><p>It is therefore possible to pay attention to species other than humans; it is just harder and less intuitive to do so.</p><figure class="image"><p><img data-credit-link="" data-credit-name="Martin Meissner" data-credit-provider="AP" data-caption="Giant machines dig for brown coal at the open-cast mining Garzweiler in front of a smoking power plant near the city of Grevenbroich in western Germany in April 2014." title="CO2 Pollution" src="http://rack.1.mshcdn.com/media/ZgkyMDE1LzA2LzEyLzBiLzVfNV8xNF9hbmRyLmY2OGFkLmpwZwpwCXRodW1iCTEyMDB4OTYwMD4/7b645755/57a/5_5_14_andrew_co2pollution2-640x360.jpg" alt="CO2 Pollution" class="" data-width="640" data-fragment="m!ecee" data-image="http://rack.1.mshcdn.com/media/ZgkyMDE1LzA2LzEyLzBiLzVfNV8xNF9hbmRyLmY2OGFkLmpwZwpwCXRodW1iCTEyMDB4OTYwMD4/7b645755/57a/5_5_14_andrew_co2pollution2-640x360.jpg" data-micro="1"></p><figcaption class="image-caption"><p>Giant machines dig for brown coal at the open-cast mining Garzweiler in front of a smoking power plant near the city of Grevenbroich in western Germany in April 2014.</p></figcaption><div class="image-credit"><p>Image: Martin Meissner/Associated Press</p></div></figure><p>Pope Francis will draw on the legacy of his predecessor and affirm the integral worth of human beings within the natural world.</p><p>A Christian perspective will not just be content to observe such changes, but will insist that another world is possible, one that hopes for a transformation of this world, and not just escape into the next. Pope John Paul II spoke of this in terms of ecological conversion. Pope Francis may use that language as well, but it is the particular human responsibility to act for explicitly moral and religious reasons that will become especially transparent.</p><p><span class="microcontent" data-fragment="caring-for-the-earth" data-description="Caring for the Earth is not an optional extra for the faithful Christian.

It is part of what it means to be human.</span></p><p>And the inspiration for that action will come from witnessing the manner of Pope Francis' call to act: a call of the heart and not just the head.</p><p>Why is it that climate science uses the quasi-religious language of belief and denial when most scientific evidence is worked out on the basis of probability and evidence? Is it because at the heart of the climate science debate there is a deeply held conviction that our natural environment is integral to our own sense of identity? </p><p>If so, that could be thought of as a secularized account of the Christian belief in creation. </p><p>Climate change denial or advocacy is not really the issue. What is at stake is a change of heart: a heart that will respond with compassion to the needs of those that are poor and the fragile Earth in which all of humanity now finds it's dwelling.</p><p><em>Celia Deane-Drummond is the inaugural director of the Center for Theology, Science and Human Flourishing, and is professor in theology at the University of Notre Dame.
