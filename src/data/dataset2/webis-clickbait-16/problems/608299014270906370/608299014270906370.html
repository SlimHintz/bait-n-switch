The Pittsburgh Penguins","date":1433859480000,"timestamp":1433893290272,"body":"<p>The Pittsburgh Penguins have peaked. The great turnaround led by Mario Lemieux, who paid $107 million for the NHL team in 1999, is complete.\r\n\r\nAlthough some have speculated the Penguins will&nbsp;<a href=\"http://pittsburgh.cbslocal.com/2015/06/04/pens-sale-cuban-not-interested-others-will-be/\" target=\"_blank\">sell for six times</a> the $107 Lemieux's group paid in 1999, I doubt it.\r\n\r\nAs Mike Colligan has so <a href=\"http://thehockeywriters.com/lemieux-burkle-part-1-cost-of-loyalty/\" target=\"_blank\">expertly pointed out</a> in his three-part series on the Penguins, the team already has a new building, is set with a long term cable television deal with Root Sports that runs through the 2028-29 season and has been selling out every home game for years. The league also has its Canadian and U.S. <a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702303281504579221712959002006\" target=\"_blank\">media deals</a> set for several years.\r\n\r\nIn addition, it will be very difficult for the team to improve and be more than a two-round playoff team. Stars like Sidney Crosby and Evgeni Malkin are <a href=\"http://penguins.nhl.com/club/news.htm?id=673891\" target=\"_blank\">locked up in long term deals</a>, and the <a href=\"http://www.spotrac.com/nhl/cap/\" target=\"_blank\">team's payroll</a> is among the highest in the league and has no cap space.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_147170475\" align=\"\" width=\"640\"]<img class=\"dam-image getty size-large wp-image-147170475\" src=\"http://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/147170475/640x0.jpg?fit=scale\" alt=\"\"> PITTSBURGH, PA - JUNE 22: Pittsburgh Penguins co-owner Mario Lemieux (Photo by Bruce Bennett/Getty Images)[/caption]\r\n\r\nHow big a score would a sale mean for Lemieux? Assuming the sale would include the hockey team and lease to <a href=\"http://www.consolenergycenter.com/\" target=\"_blank\">CONSOL Energy Center</a>, but not the <a href=\"http://www.civicarenaredevelopment.com/faqs/\" target=\"_blank\">real estate development project</a> at the former Civic Center, I figure a buyer would be looking at an enterprise value of <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/nhl-valuations/list/\" target=\"_blank\">$565 million</a> or so--about four times revenue.\r\n\r\nLast November we pegged the value of the Minnesota Wild at $370 million, which was the <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/mikeozanian/2015/02/26/hulsizers-purchase-of-minority-stake-in-minnesota-wild-values-team-at-370-million/\" target=\"_blank\">precise enterprise value</a> Matthew Hulsizer paid to get <a href='http://www.forbes.com/profile/philip-falcone/'>Philip Falcone's</a> stake the following January. The $370 million price worked out to 3.3 times trailing revenue. Both the Wild and Penguins play in new, state-of-the-art, single tenant arenas that are controlled by their NHL teams. But the Wild have been losing money while the Penguins are profitable.\r\n\r\nSelling now would be smart. Interest rates and equity valuations have been in a bull market for several years. Who knows how long it can last? Given the team's been profitable in aggregate during his 15 year ownership tenure, selling for $565 million would yield pure profit--and a 12% compound annual return.\r\n<!--donotpaginate-->\r\nHall of Famers like Lemieux have a great knack of knowing when to shoot or pass. By exploring his options to sell, Lemieux is showing he has a knack for this off the ice as well.\r\n\r\n<em><strong>Also on Forbes:</strong></em>\r\n\r\n[gallery2012]</p>","description":"The value of the Penguins have peaked.","image":"http://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/147170475/640x0.jpg?fit=scale","type":"blogslide","storyType":"post","uri":"http://www.forbes.com/sites/mikeozanian/2015/06/09/why-mario-lemieux-wants-to-sell-the-pittsburgh-penguins/","comments":[],"visible":true,"promotedChannelSections":[{"channel":"channel_1","section":"section_5","title":"Why Mario Lemieux Wants To Sell The Pittsburgh Penguins","description":"The value of the Penguins has peaked.","image":"http://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/147170475/640x0.jpg?fit=scale","location":"top"},{"channel":"channel_1","section":"","title":"Why Lemieux Wants To Sell The NHL Penguins","description":"The value of the Penguins have peaked.","image":"http://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/147170475/640x0.jpg?fit=scale","location":"top"}],"blogId":"989","authors":[{"naturalId":"blogAuthorId/blog/author/8","name":"Mike Ozanian","avatars":[{"size":136,"image":"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/53109ce94260546eb9ea6d359d5ec063?s=136&amp;d=http%3A%2F%2F1.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2Fad516503a11cd5ca435acc9bb6523536%3Fs%3D136&amp;r=G"},{"size":40,"image":"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/53109ce94260546eb9ea6d359d5ec063?s=40&amp;d=http%3A%2F%2F1.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2Fad516503a11cd5ca435acc9bb6523536%3Fs%3D40&amp;r=G"},{"size":400,"image":"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/53109ce94260546eb9ea6d359d5ec063?s=400&amp;d=http%3A%2F%2F1.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2Fad516503a11cd5ca435acc9bb6523536%3Fs%3D400&amp;r=G"},{"size":62,"image":"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/53109ce94260546eb9ea6d359d5ec063?s=62&amp;d=http%3A%2F%2F1.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2Fad516503a11cd5ca435acc9bb6523536%3Fs%3D62&amp;r=G"}],"url":"http://www.forbes.com/sites/mikeozanian/","type":"Forbes Staff","profileUrl":"/sites/mikeozanian/","twitterName":"MikeOzanian","authorType":"individual","facebookName":"michael.ozanian","email":"mozanian@forbes.com","blog":false,"numFollowers":0,"shortBio":"Traffic cop at the intersection of money and sports","timestamp":1445787593986,"description":"I like to take lots and lots of numbers and turn them into proprietary concepts and multi-platform content.

My brother in arms is Kurt Badenhausen, whom I have worked with for many years and knows more about sports numbers than anyone.","largeAvatar":"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/53109ce94260546eb9ea6d359d5ec063?s=136&amp;d=http%3A%2F%2F1.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2Fad516503a11cd5ca435acc9bb6523536%3Fs%3D136&amp;r=G","largerAvatar":"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/53109ce94260546eb9ea6d359d5ec063?s=400&amp;d=http%3A%2F%2F1.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2Fad516503a11cd5ca435acc9bb6523536%3Fs%3D400&amp;r=G","mediumAvatar":"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/53109ce94260546eb9ea6d359d5ec063?s=62&amp;d=http%3A%2F%2F1.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2Fad516503a11cd5ca435acc9bb6523536%3Fs%3D62&amp;r=G","smallAvatar":"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/53109ce94260546eb9ea6d359d5ec063?s=40&amp;d=http%3A%2F%2F1.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2Fad516503a11cd5ca435acc9bb6523536%3Fs%3D40&amp;r=G","largestAvatar":"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/53109ce94260546eb9ea6d359d5ec063?s=400&amp;d=http%3A%2F%2F1.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2Fad516503a11cd5ca435acc9bb6523536%3Fs%3D400&amp;r=G"},"topics":["sports--leisure","sportsmoney","lifestyle","business","media--entertainment"],"recentActivityCount":2,"latestActivityDate":1445518440000,"dailyActivityCount":0,"displayChannel":"business","displaySection":"mikeozanianblog","shortUri":"http://onforb.es/12liPOi","slug":"mikeozanian","contributorSince":1280851781000,"showNoVestPocket":false,"embargo":false,"enableContribContact":false,"enableTwitterFeed":false,"disableCanonical":false,"disableDigest":false}],"channelSection":[{"channelId":"channel_1"},{"channelId":"channel_1","sectionId":"section_3"},{"channelId":"channel_1","sectionId":"section_191"},{"channelId":"channel_7","sectionId":"section_95"},{"channelId":"channel_1","sectionId":"section_5"}],"slug":"SportsMoney","blogType":"individual","slides":[{"image":"/imageserve/d74205a201465cb13967f5756f9ee9b8/640x434.jpg?fit=scale&background=000000","uri":"/pictures/mlm45fleem/1-toronto-maple-leafs","shortUri":"http://onforb.es/1f0u76j","caption":"<p>Current Value: $1,300 mil.<br />Revenue 2013-2014: $190&nbsp;mil.<br />Operating Income&nbsp;2013-2014: $70.6 mil.</p><p>The Air Canada Centre was ranked by Pollstar as the 13th busiest concert venue in the world in 2013 despite limits on concert dates because the arena is shared with the Raptors of the NBA.&nbsp;</p>","title":"1.

The $370 million price worked out to 3.3 times trailing revenue. Both the Wild and Penguins play in new, state-of-the-art, single tenant arenas that are controlled by their NHL teams. But the Wild have been losing money while the Penguins are profitable.</p>\n<p>Selling now would be smart. Interest rates and equity valuations have been in a bull market for several years. Who knows how long it can last? Given the team’s been profitable in aggregate during his 15 year ownership tenure, selling for $565 million would yield pure profit–and a 12% compound annual return.</p>\n<p>Hall of Famers like Lemieux have a great knack of knowing when to shoot or pass. By exploring his options to sell, Lemieux is showing he has a knack for this off the ice as well.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Also on Forbes:</strong></em></p>\n<div class=\"article-gallery-embedded\" data-url=\"http://www.forbes.com/pictures/mlm45fleem/1-toronto-maple-leafs/\"> \n <div class=\"embedded-content clearfix\"> \n  <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/pictures/mlm45fleem/1-toronto-maple-leafs/\" class=\"clearfix\" target=\"_self\"> \n   <div class=\"article-image-box\"> \n    <!--start:main_image--> \n    <img src=\"http://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/d74205a201465cb13967f5756f9ee9b8/400x400.jpg?fit=scale&amp;background=000000\" alt=\"\" /> \n    <!--end:main_image--> \n   </div> \n   <div class=\"article-text-box\"> \n    <header> \n     <i class=\"icon icon-gallery\"></i>Gallery \n    </header> \n    <h4>NHL Team Values 2014</h4> \n    <div class=\"article-launch-gallery\"> \n     <span class=\"article-launch-text\">Launch Gallery</span> \n     <div class=\"article-slide-count\">\n       30 images \n     </div> \n    </div> \n    <button class=\"article-launch-button\"><i class=\"icon icon-chevron-right\"></i></button> \n   </div></a> \n </div> \n</div>"],"galleryId":"54f4e700da47a54de8244134","disableDigest":false,"writtenByForbesStaff":true,"channelSectionMappings":[{"id":"channel_1","channelName":"Business","url":"/business"},{"id":"channel_1section_191","channelName":"Business","sectionName":"Powering Productivity","url":"/powering-productivity"},{"id":"channel_1section_3","channelName":"Business","sectionName":"Media & Entertainment","url":"/media-entertainment"},{"id":"channel_1section_5","channelName":"Business","sectionName":"SportsMoney","url":"/sportsmoney"},{"id":"channel_7section_95","channelName":"Lifestyle","sectionName":"Sports & Leisure","url":"/sports-leisure"}],"digestDisabled":false,"brandVoiceTitle":"Why Mario Lemieux Wants To Sell The Pittsburgh Penguins","groupAuthor":{"naturalId":"blogAuthorId/blog/author/blog-989","name":"SportsMoney","avatars":[{"size":0},{"size":0},{"size":0},{"size":0}],"url":"http://www.forbes.com/sites/mikeozanian/","profileUrl":"http://blogs.forbes.com/mikeozanian/profile/","authorType":"individual","blog":true,"numFollowers":0,"timestamp":1445787654104,"recentFlag":false,"primaryBlogNaturalId":"blogAuthorId/blog/author/blog-989","primaryContributor":"blogAuthorId/blog/author/8","primaryContributorData":{"naturalId":"blogAuthorId/blog/author/8","name":"Mike Ozanian","avatars":[{"size":40,"image":"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/53109ce94260546eb9ea6d359d5ec063?s=40&amp;d=http%3A%2F%2F1.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2Fad516503a11cd5ca435acc9bb6523536%3Fs%3D40&amp;r=G"},{"size":62,"image":"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/53109ce94260546eb9ea6d359d5ec063?s=62&amp;d=http%3A%2F%2F1.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2Fad516503a11cd5ca435acc9bb6523536%3Fs%3D62&amp;r=G"},{"size":136,"image":"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/53109ce94260546eb9ea6d359d5ec063?s=136&amp;d=http%3A%2F%2F1.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2Fad516503a11cd5ca435acc9bb6523536%3Fs%3D136&amp;r=G"},{"size":400,"image":"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/53109ce94260546eb9ea6d359d5ec063?s=400&amp;d=http%3A%2F%2F1.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2Fad516503a11cd5ca435acc9bb6523536%3Fs%3D400&amp;r=G"}],"blog":false,"numFollowers":0,"shortBio":"Traffic cop at the intersection of money and sports","description":"I like to take lots and lots of numbers and turn them into proprietary concepts and multi-platform content. Three of my longstanding publishing creations: the valuations of sports teams, ranking actors and movie studios on bang for the buck (ROI) and the Forbes Fab 40 (the most valuable sports brands). My most recent idea was Names You Need To Know, which broadened my concept of list creation to include direct input from our audience. I also like to take apart corporate balance sheets to measure earnings quality and have a passion for economics (my MBA thesis at Long Island University was an empirical study on the cause of inflation in which regression analysis showed a significant correlation between the general level of prices and the money supply). Besides being an Executive Editor at Forbes I also have a gig as co-host and Managing Editor of the 3-time New York Emmy award winning Forbes SportsMoney on the YES Network and Fox Sports 1 with my buddies at YES, co-host Bob Lorenz and producer David Alfreds, both of whom have taught me a tremendous amount. I also regularly appear on Fox and CNBC to chat about the business, political and sports issues of the day. One of my favorite times is being a guest every few weeks on Larry Kudlow's radio show on WABC Saturday mornings. Larry has been a great mentor and friend. My brother in arms is Kurt Badenhausen, whom I have worked with for many years and knows more about sports numbers than anyone.","largeAvatar":"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/53109ce94260546eb9ea6d359d5ec063?s=136&amp;d=http%3A%2F%2F1.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2Fad516503a11cd5ca435acc9bb6523536%3Fs%3D136&amp;r=G","largerAvatar":"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/53109ce94260546eb9ea6d359d5ec063?s=400&amp;d=http%3A%2F%2F1.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2Fad516503a11cd5ca435acc9bb6523536%3Fs%3D400&amp;r=G","mediumAvatar":"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/53109ce94260546eb9ea6d359d5ec063?s=62&amp;d=http%3A%2F%2F1.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2Fad516503a11cd5ca435acc9bb6523536%3Fs%3D62&amp;r=G","smallAvatar":"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/53109ce94260546eb9ea6d359d5ec063?s=40&amp;d=http%3A%2F%2F1.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2Fad516503a11cd5ca435acc9bb6523536%3Fs%3D40&amp;r=G","largestAvatar":"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/53109ce94260546eb9ea6d359d5ec063?s=400&amp;d=http%3A%2F%2F1.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2Fad516503a11cd5ca435acc9bb6523536%3Fs%3D400&amp;r=G"},"topics":["sports--leisure","sportsmoney","lifestyle","business","media--entertainment"],"recentActivityCount":2,"latestActivityDate":1445518440000,"dailyActivityCount":0,"displayChannel":"business","displaySection":"mikeozanianblog","shortUri":"http://onforb.es/12liPOi","slug":"mikeozanian","contributorSince":1280851781000,"showNoVestPocket":false,"embargo":false,"enableContribContact":false,"enableTwitterFeed":false,"disableCanonical":false,"disableDigest":false},"individualAuthor":{"naturalId":"blogAuthorId/blog/author/8","name":"Mike Ozanian","avatars":[{"size":40,"image":"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/53109ce94260546eb9ea6d359d5ec063?s=40&amp;d=http%3A%2F%2F1.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2Fad516503a11cd5ca435acc9bb6523536%3Fs%3D40&amp;r=G"},{"size":62,"image":"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/53109ce94260546eb9ea6d359d5ec063?s=62&amp;d=http%3A%2F%2F1.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2Fad516503a11cd5ca435acc9bb6523536%3Fs%3D62&amp;r=G"},{"size":136,"image":"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/53109ce94260546eb9ea6d359d5ec063?s=136&amp;d=http%3A%2F%2F1.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2Fad516503a11cd5ca435acc9bb6523536%3Fs%3D136&amp;r=G"},{"size":400,"image":"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/53109ce94260546eb9ea6d359d5ec063?s=400&amp;d=http%3A%2F%2F1.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2Fad516503a11cd5ca435acc9bb6523536%3Fs%3D400&amp;r=G"}],"url":"http://www.forbes.com/sites/mikeozanian/","type":"Forbes Staff","profileUrl":"/sites/mikeozanian/","twitterName":"MikeOzanian","authorType":"individual","facebookName":"michael.ozanian","email":"mozanian@forbes.com","blog":false,"numFollowers":0,"shortBio":"Traffic cop at the intersection of money and sports","timestamp":1445787593986,"description":"I like to take lots and lots of numbers and turn them into proprietary concepts and multi-platform content. Three of my longstanding publishing creations: the valuations of sports teams, ranking actors and movie studios on bang for the buck (ROI) and the Forbes Fab 40 (the most valuable sports brands). My most recent idea was Names You Need To Know, which broadened my concept of list creation to include direct input from our audience. I also like to take apart corporate balance sheets to measure earnings quality and have a passion for economics (my MBA thesis at Long Island University was an empirical study on the cause of inflation in which regression analysis showed a significant correlation between the general level of prices and the money supply). Besides being an Executive Editor at Forbes I also have a gig as co-host and Managing Editor of the 3-time New York Emmy award winning Forbes SportsMoney on the YES Network and Fox Sports 1 with my buddies at YES, co-host Bob Lorenz and producer David Alfreds, both of whom have taught me a tremendous amount. I also regularly appear on Fox and CNBC to chat about the business, political and sports issues of the day.
