Numbers Game","date":1433955060000,"timestamp":1433955412052,"body":"<p>&ldquo;A 20-year-old male today has a better chance of having a living grandmother than a 20-year-old in 1900 had of having a living mother.&rdquo;\r\n\r\nThat&rsquo;s according to Lauren Carstensen, director of Stanford&rsquo;s Center on Longevity, who spoke during a panel on longevity at FORBES&rsquo; third annual Women&rsquo;s Summit, a gathering of hundreds of women leaders with the intention of changing the imbalance of power in business.\r\n\r\nThe questions considered by the panel, which also included Longevity Fund partner (and former member of FORBES&rsquo; 30 Under 30 list) Laura Deming, AARP CEO Jo Ann Jenkins and Robert Wood Johnson Foundation president Risa Lavizzo-Mourey, were varied: How have our lifespans changed in just a few generations? What&rsquo;s happening in longevity research right now? How can we use technology and policy not only to extend the lives we have, but also to make our golden years more, well, golden?\r\n\r\nThe panel&rsquo;s title, though, &ldquo;The Longevity Paradox: Is Living Longer Really Better?&rdquo;, posed a question that was never really on the table. &ldquo;I think the people on this panel will answer with a resounding yes when you consider the alternative,&rdquo; joked moderator Soledad O&rsquo;Brien.\r\n\r\nYet the fact remains that one of the biggest obstacles to improving longevity is convincing people it&rsquo;s worth the effort. Deming, who says she has been interested in longevity research since she was eight years old, gets plenty of skepticism when she tells people she funds it for a living. &ldquo;People would be like, &lsquo;That is the stupidest thing I&rsquo;ve ever heard. Why would you want to live longer?&rsquo;&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It was this visceral reaction to the idea that you could live a longer life.&rdquo;\r\n\r\nAll of the women on the panel have seen similar reactions to their work. To Lavizzo-Mourey, it&rsquo;s a question of &ldquo;how we keep people functional their whole life.&rdquo; Carstensen suspects that when it comes to the years that have been added to average life expectancy, we mentally &rdquo;tacked it on at the end made old age longer and nothing else.&rdquo;\r\n\r\nIt&rsquo;s changing that culture that poses the biggest problem. &ldquo;I think that our beliefs have not kept up with the way we are aging,&rdquo; explained Jenkins. &ldquo;We continue to perpetuate these negative stereotypes of aging when we&rsquo;re not living that way every day.&rdquo;\r\n\r\nThat culture, all the experts agreed, is the direct result of the inability of younger people to identify with those decades older, or to relate to the idea that they, too, will be that older generation one day. Deming, at 21 years old, was upfront about her lack of identification with some hypothetical older self: she eats too much sugar, she says, even though she knows it&rsquo;s a major contributor to health issues later in life. &ldquo;I just mentally don&rsquo;t care.&rdquo;\r\n\r\nCarstensen has addressed the <a href=\"http://www.dangoldstein.com/papers/Hershfield_Goldstein_et_al_Increasing_Saving_Behavior_Age_Progressed_Renderings_Future_Self.pdf\">relatability problem</a> before: in a study, she had participants interact with a virtual avatar of themselves, either current or aged. Those who interacted with the older version of themselves later said they would save more for retirement than those who saw themselves as they looked at the time of the study.\r\nBut digital avatars aren&rsquo;t an everyday solution. In the meantime, we&rsquo;ll have to settle for a more old-fashioned way of relating to elderly people as fellow human beings: intergenerational interaction. &ldquo;It often happens when they become a caregiver,&rdquo; Lavizzo-Mourey said, &ldquo;that all of a sudden you realize what the future could look like, how you might influence it, and how profoundly connected you are to these people.&rdquo;\r\n\r\nIt&rsquo;s that point of connection that can help nudge our culture toward the realization that age -- no matter what it is -- doesn&rsquo;t have to carry a stigma.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;50 is not the new 30,&rdquo; exhorted Jenkins. &ldquo;50 is the new 50, and it looks good.&rdquo;\r\n\r\n<!--donotpaginate--></p>","description":"The biggest problem with longevity, according to a panel at the third annual FORBES Women's Summit, is convincing people its a good thing.","image":"http://blogs-images.forbes.com/sarahhedgecock/files/2015/06/IMG_4175-e1433954768228-300x169.jpg","type":"blog","storyType":"post","uri":"http://www.forbes.com/sites/sarahhedgecock/2015/06/10/why-longevity-isnt-just-a-numbers-game/","comments":[],"visible":true,"promotedChannelSections":[{"channel":"channel_1","section":"section_4","title":"Why Longevity Isn't Only A Numbers Game","description":"The biggest problem with longevity, according to a panel at the third annual FORBES Women's Summit, is convincing people its a good thing.","image":"http://blogs-images.forbes.com/sarahhedgecock/files/2015/06/IMG_4175-e1433954768228-300x169.jpg","location":"top"}],"blogId":"3357","authors":[{"naturalId":"blogAuthorId/blog/author/1348643","name":"Sarah Hedgecock","avatars":[{"size":136,"image":"http://blogs-images.forbes.com/files/2014/08/sarahhedgecock_avatar_1408475497.jpg"},{"size":40,"image":"http://blogs-images.forbes.com/files/2014/08/sarahhedgecock_avatar_1408475497-40x40.jpg"},{"size":400,"image":"http://blogs-images.forbes.com/files/2014/08/sarahhedgecock_avatar_1408475497.jpg"},{"size":62,"image":"http://blogs-images.forbes.com/files/2014/08/sarahhedgecock_avatar_1408475497-62x62.jpg"}],"url":"http://www.forbes.com/sites/sarahhedgecock/","type":"Forbes Staff","profileUrl":"/sites/sarahhedgecock/","twitterName":"smhedgecock","authorType":"individual","linkedIn":"https://www.linkedin.com/pub/sarah-hedgecock/54/873/843","email":"shedgecock@forbes.com","blog":false,"numFollowers":0,"shortBio":"I cover health and science.","timestamp":1445791630998,"description":"I produce the Pharma and Healthcare channel here.
