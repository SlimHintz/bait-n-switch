Authenticated Streaming To Computer And Mobile Devices","date":1434036600000,"timestamp":1434050473552,"body":"<p>Baseball fans will now be able to get MLB Network, not only on their television, but on their computer and <a href='http://www.forbes.com/mobile/'>mobile</a> devices. The network owned by Major League Baseball and their clubs today began providing an authenticated stream of its 24/7, baseball programming via MLB.com At Bat for smartphones and tablets and online at <a href=\"http://MLBNetwork.com\">MLBNetwork.com</a>. [tweet_quote display=\"MLB Network is first league-owned TV sports network offering live, authenticated stream of its programming\"]It marks the first time that a league-owned television sports network has offered live, authenticated stream of its programming on PC/Mac, iPhone, iPad and supported Android smartphones and tablets across multiple distributors.[/tweet_quote]</p>\r\nAll MLB Network studio shows, original programming, regular season, Postseason and Spring Training game telecasts, and analysis from the likes of Bob Costas, Peter Gammons, Al Leiter, Pedro Martinez, Harold Reynolds, Ken Rosenthal, John Smoltz and Tom Verducci, will be available.\r\n\r\nThere is a catch as cord-cutters will be unable to access the network show streaming. Like the FOX broadcasts of the postseason recently, and FOX Sports Go, those that wish to watch the stream of MLB Network will need to provide proof that they are a pay-TV subscriber. Eight of the top ten pay TV providers in the U.S., including [entity display=\"AT&amp;T\" type=\"organization\" subtype=\"company\" active=\"true\" key=\"att\" ticker=\"T\" exchange=\"NYSE\" natural_id=\"fred/company/354\"]AT&amp;T[/entity] U-verse TV, Bright House Networks, Cablevision/Optimum, [entity display=\"Cox Communications\" type=\"organization\" subtype=\"company\" active=\"true\" key=\"cox-communications\" exchange=\"NYSE\" natural_id=\"fred/company/1131\"]Cox Communications[/entity], DirecTV, DISH, [entity display=\"Time Warner Cable\" type=\"organization\" subtype=\"company\" active=\"true\" key=\"time-warner-cable\" ticker=\"TWC\" exchange=\"NYSE\" natural_id=\"fred/company/6488\"]Time Warner Cable[/entity], and Verizon FiOS, will authenticate MLB Network subscribers via the MLB.com At Bat app and online at MLBNetwork.com. That would leave [entity display=\"Comcast\" type=\"organization\" subtype=\"company\" active=\"true\" key=\"comcast\" ticker=\"CMCSA\" exchange=\"NASDAQ\" natural_id=\"fred/company/1046\"]Comcast[/entity] and Charter subscribers out of the mix, at least at the initial launch.\r\n<p class=\"tweet_line\">[tweet_quote display=\"As of this morning, the stream will include all MLB Network programming, including games\"]As of this morning, the stream will include all MLB Network[/tweet_quote] &nbsp;studio shows, original programming, and regular season, Postseason and Spring Training game telecasts. MLB Advanced Media, the digital media company of Major League Baseball, that currently streams games daily, is providing the infrastructure to stream MLB Network.\r\n\r\nThe launch is ahead of tonight&rsquo;s <em>MLB Network Showcase</em> telecast of the defending World Series champion San Francisco Giants at New York Mets at 7:00 p.m. ET, the HD-quality stream will be available via MLB.com At Bat and at MLBNetwork.com for viewers after they have logged in with their TV provider credentials.\r\n\r\nFor those wondering whether they will now somehow be able to get around the league&rsquo;s TV blackout policy, think again. MLB Network states that as with MLB Network game telecasts, games watched via the authenticated stream will be subject to local blackouts depending on the user&rsquo;s location. Users in areas subject to blackouts will be provided with an alternate game or other programming.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_cc4cee01b7d44d28b1600d651a425e14\" align=\"\" width=\"640\"]<img class=\"dam-image ap size-large wp-image-cc4cee01b7d44d28b1600d651a425e14\" src=\"http://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/cc4cee01b7d44d28b1600d651a425e14/640x0.jpg?fit=scale\" alt=\"\"> National Baseball Hall of Fame inductee Pedro Martinez is interviewed during a taping of a show at Stuido 42 at the MLB Network following a press conference showcasing the 2015 hall of fame class, Wednesday, Jan. 7, 2015, in Secaucus, N.J.
