Taxes","date":1433855700000,"timestamp":1435767622445,"body":"<p class=\"normal\">The best <a href='http://www.forbes.com/taxes/'>taxes</a> are the taxes you don&rsquo;t have to pay.</p>\r\n<p class=\"normal\">With that in mind, I recently asked my team to run some numbers for me. I wanted to know how many of the businesses we&rsquo;ve evaluated over the last decade or so were overpaying on their taxes.</p>\r\n<p class=\"normal\">The number came back as 93%. More than nine in 10&nbsp;<a href='http://www.forbes.com/business/'>business</a> owners were overpaying on their taxes&nbsp;&ndash; regardless of whether they were paying for a high-priced accountant or not.</p>\r\n<p class=\"normal\">That&rsquo;s sad, but no surprise. The federal tax code and supporting documents to help tax lawyers, accountants, and CPAs understand and navigate taxes totals more than 70,000 pages long. Without a production-minded accountant who specializes in your area of business, identifying and claiming all of your tax savings is a Herculean task.</p>\r\n<p class=\"normal\">I recently talked with my CPA, Brett Sellers, to see if he could break down tax-savings into something more approachable than the mammoth IRS tax code. And he delivered. Brett reports that there are four main ways for <a href='http://www.forbes.com/entrepreneurs/'>entrepreneurs</a> to save on their taxes, and two are far superior to the others.</p>\r\n<b>Tax-Saver 1: Defer it away</b>\r\n<p class=\"normal\">One of the easiest and most common ways to save on taxes, allegedly, is to defer taxes. I say &ldquo;allegedly&rdquo; because the taxes must still be paid&ndash;just at a later date.</p>\r\n<p class=\"normal\">Here&rsquo;s what Brett says: &ldquo;Deferred tax savings are where you get a deduction now and you pay tax later, hoping that you&rsquo;re at a lower tax bracket. The classic example is the 401(k).&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p class=\"normal\">And it&rsquo;s true. Every dollar that you put into a 401(k) or IRA is deducted from your taxable income or more accurately you have allocated the money to a savings vehicle pre-tax.</p>\r\n<p class=\"normal\">The hope is that when you withdraw the money in retirement, you&rsquo;ll be in a lower tax bracket.</p>\r\n<p class=\"normal\">But that thinking doesn&rsquo;t work for entrepreneurs. If your business is successful in the long-term, you&rsquo;ll be in a higher tax bracket, not a lower one.</p>\r\n<p class=\"normal\">And here&rsquo;s another thing to think about: which direction do you think taxes are going, up or down? In more than 10 years of speaking to large groups and asking this question from the stage, only one hand has gone up to say that taxes are going down.</p>\r\n<p class=\"normal\">The facts are that government debt is at a record high while taxes are at historical lows. It doesn&rsquo;t take a fortune teller to see that taxes are likely to go up. So why wait to pay taxes?</p>\r\n<p class=\"normal\">&ldquo;[Deferred tax savings are] probably the least effective way of saving taxes,&rdquo; says Brett, &ldquo;And investing in a 401(k) particularly doesn&rsquo;t make sense for the entrepreneur because they can get a better rate of return by investing in their own business.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<b>Tax-Saver 2: Spend It Away</b>\r\n<p class=\"normal\">This won&rsquo;t come as news to entrepreneurs, but the more you spend on your business, the more tax deductions you earn. In fact, if you spend enough money you can reduce your taxes to zero.</p>\r\n<p class=\"normal\">You can spend money to reduce your taxes by hiring a new employee, buying new equipment, running an advertising campaign and more.</p>\r\n<p class=\"normal\">But you don&rsquo;t want to let the tax-tail wag the dog. Spending $1 to save 30 or 40 cents in tax is never a smart move. So if the expense doesn&rsquo;t make your business more profitable, then it&rsquo;s not a smart way to save tax.</p>\r\n<b>Tax-Saver 3: Connect Personal Spending to Your Business</b>\r\n<p class=\"normal\">Because business expenses are deductible, entrepreneurs have an advantage over other taxpayers. They can find tax deductions where others cannot&ndash;in their personal expenses.</p>\r\n<p class=\"normal\">Brett says, &ldquo;Look at your personal spending&ndash;where you&rsquo;re spending money already&ndash;and see if you can connect that to your business. So we&rsquo;re not spending new dollars, we&rsquo;re re-characterizing existing spending in a more tax-advantaged way.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p class=\"normal\">The most classic example is the home office. You&rsquo;re already spending money on your home. But if you can build a case and document that a portion of your home is used for business, then a personal expense becomes a business expense.</p>\r\n<p class=\"normal\">&ldquo;I have my clients look at their last 2 months of credit card bills and bank statements and really challenge themselves as to whether there&rsquo;s a business connection to any of those charges,&rdquo; says Brett.</p>\r\n<p class=\"normal\"><a href='http://www.forbes.com/travel/'>Travel</a> expenses, education expenses, magazine subscriptions, and more&ndash;these are all expenses that could possibly be connected to your business. If they are connected, then you just found a way to lower your taxes without spending any more money.</p>\r\n<b>Tax-Saver 4: Lower Your Tax Rate</b>\r\n<p class=\"normal\">The fourth way for entrepreneurs to save on taxes is to lower the rate at which you are taxed.</p>\r\n<p class=\"normal\">One way to do this is to change the tax you&rsquo;re paying from ordinary income tax to a capital gains tax.</p>\r\n<p class=\"normal\">Ordinary income is taxed as high as 39.6%. The capital gains tax can be as low as 0%, but is typically 15%-20% for most individuals. So you&rsquo;ll save big if a CPA can help you transfer some of your income to capital gains.</p>\r\n<p class=\"normal\">&ldquo;I was just talking to a business owner this morning,&rdquo; said Brett. &ldquo;We were structuring the sale of her business so that there were more capital gains coming off the sale of the business than ordinary income. That lowers her tax rate&ndash;same income, but it&rsquo;s taxed at a different tax rate.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p class=\"normal\">There are many other ways to lower your tax rate as well.</p>\r\n<p class=\"normal\">For example, some business owners have elderly parents who live with them. If you&rsquo;re supporting your parents, you can hire them to work for you. Because they&rsquo;re likely in a lower tax bracket, the income comes into the family at a lower tax rate.</p>\r\n<p class=\"normal\">You can do the same with kids. Your kids can work for you and earn up to $6,000 per year without owing any income tax&ndash;and that money can go straight to their college savings account.</p>\r\n<p class=\"normal\">Some investment vehicles are taxed more favorably than others, too. For example, the growth inside of a life insurance policy is never taxed. Real estate is another popular investment with favorable tax advantages.</p>\r\n<p class=\"normal\">I doubt if any one person in the world completely understands the tax code. But if you or your CPA understand these four ways to save, you can begin to put an end to overpaying on taxes.</p>\r\n<p class=\"normal\"><em><strong>Also on

I wanted to know how many of the businesses we’ve evaluated over the last decade or so were overpaying on their taxes.</p>\n<p>The number came back as 93%. More than nine in 10&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/business/\" target=\"_self\">business</a> owners were overpaying on their taxes&nbsp;– regardless of whether they were paying for a high-priced accountant or not.</p>\n<p>That’s sad, but no surprise. The federal tax code and supporting documents to help tax lawyers, accountants, and CPAs understand and navigate taxes totals more than 70,000 pages long. Without a production-minded accountant who specializes in your area of business, identifying and claiming all of your tax savings is a Herculean task.</p>\n<p>I recently talked with my CPA, Brett Sellers, to see if he could break down tax-savings into something more approachable than the mammoth IRS tax code. And he delivered. Brett reports that there are four main ways for <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/entrepreneurs/\" target=\"_self\">entrepreneurs</a> to save on their taxes, and two are far superior to the others.</p>\n<div id=\"inread\" article-ad-inbody=\"inread\" class=\"inread\"></div>\n<p><b>Tax-Saver 1: Defer it away</b></p>\n<p>One of the easiest and most common ways to save on taxes, allegedly, is to defer taxes. I say “allegedly” because the taxes must still be paid–just at a later date.</p>\n<p>Here’s what Brett says: “Deferred tax savings are where you get a deduction now and you pay tax later, hoping that you’re at a lower tax bracket. The classic example is the 401(k).”</p>\n<div class=\"vestpocket\" vest-pocket=\"\"></div>\n<p>And it’s true. Every dollar that you put into a 401(k) or IRA is deducted from your taxable income or more accurately you have allocated the money to a savings vehicle pre-tax.</p>\n<p>The hope is that when you withdraw the money in retirement, you’ll be in a lower tax bracket.</p>\n<p>But that thinking doesn’t work for entrepreneurs. If your business is successful in the long-term, you’ll be in a higher tax bracket, not a lower one.</p>\n<p>And here’s another thing to think about: which direction do you think taxes are going, up or down? In more than 10 years of speaking to large groups and asking this question from the stage, only one hand has gone up to say that taxes are going down.</p>\n<p>The facts are that government debt is at a record high while taxes are at historical lows. It doesn’t take a fortune teller to see that taxes are likely to go up. So why wait to pay taxes?</p>\n<p>“[Deferred tax savings are] probably the least effective way of saving taxes,” says Brett, “And investing in a 401(k) particularly doesn’t make sense for the entrepreneur because they can get a better rate of return by investing in their own business.”</p>\n<p><b>Tax-Saver 2: Spend It Away</b></p>\n<p>This won’t come as news to entrepreneurs, but the more you spend on your business, the more tax deductions you earn. In fact, if you spend enough money you can reduce your taxes to zero.</p>\n<p>You can spend money to reduce your taxes by hiring a new employee, buying new equipment, running an advertising campaign and more.</p>\n<p>But you don’t want to let the tax-tail wag the dog. Spending $1 to save 30 or 40 cents in tax is never a smart move. So if the expense doesn’t make your business more profitable, then it’s not a smart way to save tax.</p>\n<p><b>Tax-Saver 3: Connect Personal Spending to Your Business</b></p>\n<p>Because business expenses are deductible, entrepreneurs have an advantage over other taxpayers. They can find tax deductions where others cannot–in their personal expenses.</p>\n<p>Brett says, “Look at your personal spending–where you’re spending money already–and see if you can connect that to your business. So we’re not spending new dollars, we’re re-characterizing existing spending in a more tax-advantaged way.”</p>\n<p>The most classic example is the home office. You’re already spending money on your home. But if you can build a case and document that a portion of your home is used for business, then a personal expense becomes a business expense.</p>\n<p>“I have my clients look at their last 2 months of credit card bills and bank statements and really challenge themselves as to whether there’s a business connection to any of those charges,” says Brett.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/travel/\" target=\"_self\">Travel</a> expenses, education expenses, magazine subscriptions, and more–these are all expenses that could possibly be connected to your business. If they are connected, then you just found a way to lower your taxes without spending any more money.</p>\n<p><b>Tax-Saver 4: Lower Your Tax Rate</b></p>\n<p>The fourth way for entrepreneurs to save on taxes is to lower the rate at which you are taxed.</p>\n<p>One way to do this is to change the tax you’re paying from ordinary income tax to a capital gains tax.</p>\n<p>Ordinary income is taxed as high as 39.6%. The capital gains tax can be as low as 0%, but is typically 15%-20% for most individuals. So you’ll save big if a CPA can help you transfer some of your income to capital gains.</p>\n<p>“I was just talking to a business owner this morning,” said Brett. “We were structuring the sale of her business so that there were more capital gains coming off the sale of the business than ordinary income. That lowers her tax rate–same income, but it’s taxed at a different tax rate.”</p>\n<p>There are many other ways to lower your tax rate as well.</p>\n<p>For example, some business owners have elderly parents who live with them. If you’re supporting your parents, you can hire them to work for you. Because they’re likely in a lower tax bracket, the income comes into the family at a lower tax rate.</p>\n<p>You can do the same with kids. Your kids can work for you and earn up to $6,000 per year without owing any income tax–and that money can go straight to their college savings account.</p>\n<p>Some investment vehicles are taxed more favorably than others, too. For example, the growth inside of a life insurance policy is never taxed. Real estate is another popular investment with favorable tax advantages.</p>\n<p>I doubt if any one person in the world completely understands the tax code. But if you or your CPA understand these four ways to save, you can begin to put an end to overpaying on taxes.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Also on Forbes:</strong></em></p>\n<div
