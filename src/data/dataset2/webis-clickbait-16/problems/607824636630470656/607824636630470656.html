Presidents","date":1433714400000,"timestamp":1433783511071,"body":"<p>According to a <a href=\"http://www.chronicle.com/compensation\">report</a> just released by <em>The Chronicle of Higher Education</em>, the nation&rsquo;s three highest-earning public college presidents are no longer in their posts. Often university presidents reap the greatest rewards when they leave their jobs because they receive severance, deferred compensation or other rewards. The top earner: Rodney A. Erickson, president of Pennsylvania State University from November 2011 to May 2014. His total compensation of $1,494,603 included the $586,000 balance of a university-sponsored life-insurance plan that the school had terminated.\r\n\r\nThe second-highest-earner, R. Bowen Loftin, who had the top job at Texas A&amp;M University at College Station from February 2010 to January 2014, raked in a severance package of $850,000, which went a long way toward boosting his total compensation to $1,128,957. Some schools opt to pay big exit packages in exchange for agreements by departing presidents that they will not bring any future legal claims.\r\n\r\nIn third place, Joseph A. Alutto was interim president of Ohio State University for just under a year, from July 2013 to June 2014. His compensation: $996,169. That included a generous bonus of $361,507. He stepped in after the sudden departure of 2013&rsquo;s highest-paid public university president, E. Gordon Gee, who took home more than $5 million when he left OSU, including a large severance award. Gee, widely regarded as a masterful fundraiser, departed suddenly after a series of malapropisms, including one criticizing Catholic leaders at Notre Dame. He is now president of <a href='http://www.forbes.com/colleges/west-virginia-university/'>West Virginia University</a>,\r\n\r\nPenn State&rsquo;s Erickson garnered both <a href=\"http://www.pennlive.com/midstate/index.ssf/2014/05/outgoing_penn_state_president.html\">major kudos and heated controversy</a> along with his big payday. A 37-year veteran of the university, he delayed his own retirement and took charge when Penn State was reeling from the explosive Jerry Sandusky sex abuse scandal. Erickson&rsquo;s predecessor, Graham Spanier, still faces a criminal indictment for charges ranging from child endangerment to perjury and conspiring to cover up Sandusky&rsquo;s crimes. (Spanier has denied the charges and filed a <a href=\"http://freehreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/1-Complaint-in-Spanier-v.-Freeh-and-Penn-State.pdf\">defamation suit</a> against former FBI director Louis Freeh, who issued a damning report on the scandal.) Erickson steered Penn State through very rocky terrain, including the Freeh report and stiff, controversial sanctions on the school&rsquo;s football program. Erickson&rsquo;s replacement is former Florida state president Eric Barron.\r\n\r\nThe <em>Chronicle</em> also notes that Spanier, along with 42 other former college presidents, is still receiving compensation from his former employer. According to the <em>Chronicle</em>, he earned more than any public university president--nearly $2.3 million--last year. A Penn State spokeswoman says he has been on administrative leave since November 2012 and that his employment agreement entitled him to one year&rsquo;s sabbatical and five years at a $600,000 salary as a tenured faculty member. He is also receiving a payout from the life insurance program divestiture.\r\n\r\nAccording to the <em>Chronicle</em>, the typical college president earned $428,000 last year, nearly 3.8 times more than the average full-time professor and 7% more than the median for college presidents in fiscal 2013. Adjuncts, who make up an increasingly large share of university teaching staff (<a href=\"http://www.aaup.org/sites/default/files/files/2015salarysurvey/Fig4.pdf\">47% in 2013 according to the American Association of University Professors</a>, while grad students comprise 12% of the teaching staff) make a fraction of what full-time professors earn and peanuts compared to university presidents. Adjuncts bring home as little as $900-$5,000 per course, according to John Barshaw, a senior researcher at the American Association of University Professors.\r\n\r\nA year ago a <a href=\"http://www.ips-dc.org/one_percent_universities/\">report</a> by the Institute for Policy Studies, a left-leaning Washington, DC think tank, showed that the 25 public universities with the highest-paid presidents had the fastest-growing levels of student debt and the most rapidly expanding adjunct faculties. The report looked at the period between 2005 and 2012. Says the report: &ldquo;Administrative spending outstripped scholarship spending by more than two to one at state schools with the highest-paid presidents.&rdquo;\r\n\r\nWhile universities maintain that presidents&rsquo; compensation is a minimal share of overall university budgets, there is increasing protest in some quarters about bloated presidential pay. The Illinois State Democratic Caucus issues a <a href=\"http://www.illinoissenatedemocrats.com/images/PDFS/2015/Illinois_Higher_Ed_Comp_Report_Final.pdf\">report</a> in May that criticized the cash bonuses, country club memberships and housing and vehicles that many college presidents receive on top of generous base salaries. The Chronicle report documents some of these perks, like the university-owned house University of Illinois at Chicago president Paula Allen-Meares enjoyed and the $450,000 in deferred compensation she got when she left her post in January 2015.\r\n<!--nextpage-->\r\nHow do private university presidents compare? According to a report the <em>Chronicle</em> released in December about earnings in fiscal 2012, the median salary for private presidents was $400,000, lower than for public university bosses, though the presidents at the top of the list made much more than public presidents. The top three private university earners:\r\n\r\n<strong>Shirley Ann Jackson</strong>, <a href='http://www.forbes.com/colleges/rensselaer-polytechnic-institute/'>Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute</a> , July 1999 - current, $7,143,312\r\n\r\n<strong>John L. Lahey</strong>, <a href='http://www.forbes.com/colleges/quinnipiac-university/'>Quinnipiac University</a>, March 1987 - current, $3,759,076\r\n\r\n<strong>Lee C.

I’ve chased South Africa’s first black billionaire through a Cape Town shopping mall while admirers flocked around him, climbed inside the hidden chamber in the home of an antiquarian arms and armor dealer atop San Francisco’s Telegraph Hill, and sipped Chateau Latour with one of Picasso’s grandsons in the Venice art museum of French tycoon François Pinault. I’ve edited the magazine’s Lifestyle section and opinion pieces by the likes of John Bogle and Gordon Bethune.

to a <a href=\"http://www.chronicle.com/compensation\">report</a> just released by <em>The Chronicle of Higher Education</em>, the nation’s three highest-earning public college presidents are no longer in their posts. Often university presidents reap the greatest rewards when they leave their jobs because they receive severance, deferred compensation or other rewards. The top earner: Rodney A. Erickson, president of Pennsylvania State University from November 2011 to May 2014. His total compensation of $1,494,603 included the $586,000 balance of a university-sponsored life-insurance plan that the school had terminated.</p>\n<p>The second-highest-earner, R. Bowen Loftin, who had the top job at Texas A&amp;M University at College Station from February 2010 to January 2014, raked in a severance package of $850,000, which went a long way toward boosting his total compensation to $1,128,957. Some schools opt to pay big exit packages in exchange for agreements by departing presidents that they will not bring any future legal claims.</p>\n<p>In third place, Joseph A. Alutto was interim president of Ohio State University for just under a year, from July 2013 to June 2014. His compensation: $996,169. That included a generous bonus of $361,507. He stepped in after the sudden departure of 2013’s highest-paid public university president, E. Gordon Gee, who took home more than $5 million when he left OSU, including a large severance award. Gee, widely regarded as a masterful fundraiser, departed suddenly after a series of malapropisms, including one criticizing Catholic leaders at Notre Dame. He is now president of <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/colleges/west-virginia-university/\" target=\"_self\">West Virginia University</a>,</p>\n<p>Penn State’s Erickson garnered both <a href=\"http://www.pennlive.com/midstate/index.ssf/2014/05/outgoing_penn_state_president.html\">major kudos and heated controversy</a> along with his big payday. A 37-year veteran of the university, he delayed his own retirement and took charge when Penn State was reeling from the explosive Jerry Sandusky sex abuse scandal. Erickson’s predecessor, Graham Spanier, still faces a criminal indictment for charges ranging from child endangerment to perjury and conspiring to cover up Sandusky’s crimes. (Spanier has denied the charges and filed a <a href=\"http://freehreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/1-Complaint-in-Spanier-v.-Freeh-and-Penn-State.pdf\">defamation suit</a> against former FBI director Louis Freeh, who issued a damning report on the scandal.) Erickson steered Penn State through very rocky terrain, including the Freeh report and stiff, controversial sanctions on the school’s football program. Erickson’s replacement is former Florida state president Eric Barron.</p>\n<div id=\"inread\" article-ad-inbody=\"inread\" class=\"inread\"></div>\n<p>The <em>Chronicle</em> also notes that Spanier, along with 42 other former college presidents, is still receiving compensation from his former employer. According to the <em>Chronicle</em>, he earned more than any public university president–nearly $2.3 million–last year. A Penn State spokeswoman says he has been on administrative leave since November 2012 and that his employment agreement entitled him to one year’s sabbatical and five years at a $600,000 salary as a tenured faculty member. He is also receiving a payout from the life insurance program divestiture.</p>\n<p>According to the <em>Chronicle</em>, the typical college president earned $428,000 last year, nearly 3.8 times more than the average full-time professor and 7% more than the median for college presidents in fiscal 2013. Adjuncts, who make up an increasingly large share of university teaching staff (<a href=\"http://www.aaup.org/sites/default/files/files/2015salarysurvey/Fig4.pdf\">47% in 2013 according to the American Association of University Professors</a>, while grad students comprise 12% of the teaching staff) make a fraction of what full-time professors earn and peanuts compared to university presidents. Adjuncts bring home as little as $900-$5,000 per course, according to John Barshaw, a senior researcher at the American Association of University Professors.</p>\n<div class=\"vestpocket\" vest-pocket=\"\"></div>\n<p>A year ago a <a href=\"http://www.ips-dc.org/one_percent_universities/\">report</a> by the Institute for Policy Studies, a left-leaning Washington, DC think tank, showed that the 25 public universities with the highest-paid presidents had the fastest-growing levels of student debt and the most rapidly expanding adjunct faculties. The report looked at the period between 2005 and 2012. Says the report: “Administrative spending outstripped scholarship spending by more than two to one at state schools with the highest-paid presidents.”</p>\n<p>While universities maintain that presidents’ compensation is a minimal share of overall university budgets, there is increasing protest in some quarters about bloated presidential pay. The Illinois State Democratic Caucus issues a <a href=\"http://www.illinoissenatedemocrats.com/images/PDFS/2015/Illinois_Higher_Ed_Comp_Report_Final.pdf\">report</a> in May that criticized the cash bonuses, country club memberships and housing and vehicles that many college presidents receive on top of generous base salaries. The Chronicle report documents some of these perks, like the university-owned house University of Illinois at Chicago president Paula Allen-Meares enjoyed and the $450,000 in deferred compensation she got when she left her post in January 2015.</p>","<p>How do private university presidents compare? According to a report the <em>Chronicle</em> released in December about earnings in fiscal 2012, the median salary for private presidents was $400,000, lower than for public university bosses, though the presidents at the top of the list made much more than public presidents.
