Epstein","author":"Eli Epstein","articleBody":"Presented By the Infiniti Q50\nThere\u2019s you. Then there\u2019s you with tech that helps make you a better you.\n\nAs much as we've grown to love the always increasing number of zany smart devices in our lives (hello, brewing coffee using your smartphone), new technologies enable us to do much more than automate and simplify mundane tasks.\nAround the world, revolutionary technological ideas are helping individuals live fuller lives, engage with their communities and, most importantly, help others. \nIn this piece, Mashable examines three cutting-edge technologies and speaks with those who they've inspired and empowered.\nKristen Regelein\nConquering wearable tech and owning the boardroom\nFor almost as long as Kristen Regelein can remember, hearing aids have been a bane.\nDeaf since the age of three, Regelein was teased and ignored by her peers in school because of her deafness and listening devices. \n\"Growing up, I had a hard time not letting my hearing loss keep me from interacting with others,\" she says. \"When people did know I had a hearing loss, I was bullied and picked on.\"\n\"I was left out of many social events growing up because I wasn't able to adapt to the situation,\" she adds.\nRegelein would try to hide her hearing aids behind her long hair, but that didn't always work. She says she struggled with self-confidence and depression for many years because of the harassment and social isolation.\n\"I worried every day that someone would see them and treat me differently,\" she says.\nDespite her disability, Regelein forged ahead. She received a degree from the Heald Institute of Technology in electronics and spent the next decade selling and supporting technologies, from iPod accessories to phone cases, for a variety of high-profile manufacturers.\nSince last year, Regelein has worn the\u00a0Starkey's Halo hearing aid, which is nearly invisible and Bluetooth-compatible, so Regelein can use the devices to wirelessly talk on her smartphone or listen to music. \nWith the Halos, Regelein can also inconspicuously increase or mute the sound in her earpiece, depending on the environment.\n\"Over the last few years, hearing aids have gotten better at adapting to new technology, incorporating Bluetooth and a clearer digital signal, along with a more invisible aesthetic,\" she says.\n\nHearing aids, over time, have become more inconspicuous and, recently, capable of working with other devices.\n\nDespite those advances, Regelein's hearing impairment still presented her with challenges in the workplace, especially as she's moved into managerial roles that include many face-to-face discussions with clients. \nIn business meetings, for example, Regelein can't always take out her phone to adjust the sound on her hearing aids, because doing so might seem discourteous to those who don't know about her disability. \n\"My personal and professional life depends heavily on my listening and communication out to the world,\" she says.\"When your job is to negotiate deals, it could be challenging to find an appropriate way to adjust my hearing aids with my iPhone.\"\nIn her current role of head of global sales at Pebble, the smartwatch maker, Regelein has endeavored to make wearable technology more appealing and helpful to the Deaf and Hard of Hearing Community. \nSo far, she's partnered with Starkey to connect the manufacturer's Bluetooth hearing aids with Pebble watches.\u00a0\nNo one has any idea that I'm using my Pebble to control what I hear in the moment. When they do know, they find it super cool.\n\nRegelein leads efforts at Pebble to make smartwatches more helpful for deaf users.\n\nBecause of that union,\u00a0deaf users are able to control their hearing devices by covertly pressing a button on their smartwatch -- an action meant to avoid disturbing anyone or drawing glances in a business setting.\n\"No one has any idea that I'm using my Pebble to control what I hear in the moment,\" Regelein says. \"When they do know,\" she adds, \"instead of worrying about what they think, they find it super cool \u2014 especially the mute button feature.\"\nGoing forward, Regelein says she'll continue to work on developing technologies that help people with disabilities gain confidence in all of their activities, much like how a combination of Starkey hearing aids and a Pebble Watch have helped her feel more comfortable with clients.  \n\"I never want anyone to struggle the way I did growing up because of a disability or challenge they face,\" she says. \"My lifelong mission is to continue to be a strong advocate and voice championing empowering products that enhance the way we hear the world.\"\nMy lifelong mission is to continue to be a strong advocate and voice championing empowering products that enhance the way we hear the world.\nChris Merkle\nA vet uses virtual-reality therapy to overcome PTSD\nIn 2010, Chris Merkle returned home to California after spending most of the prior two decades in Iraq and Afghanistan as a Marine, Army Reservist and private security contractor. \nGoing home to the ocean waves he grew up near -- and left at 17 to join the Marines -- brought Merkle comfort, but also uncertainty and uneasiness.\nNow, out of the military and trying to adapt to the slower pace of civilian life, Merkle found himself increasingly startled, irritable and hyper-vigilant, even during his down time. \nAt night, he struggled to fall asleep, and, when he finally did go to sleep, he'd have nightmares. \nThat cycle would repeat itself as lack of sleep led to more stress, irritability and further sleeplessness.\n\"You feel like you\u2019re always reacting,\" Merkle recalls. \"It wears you down. It isn't healthy for your body to stay in a ready state.\"\nIn the years that followed, U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs doctors diagnosed Merkle with post-traumatic stress disorder and prescribed him therapy, but face-to-face counseling wasn't helping him sleep or feel more at ease, he says. \n\"I couldn't get past the niceties of psychotherapy,\" Merkle says. \"You have to establish a rapport and build up to talking about something horrible. Then, every time you see a therapist -- a day, a week or maybe a month apart -- you have to reestablish that rapport.\"\n\"I never got to delve into issues,\" he says. \"I'd deflect questions.\"\n\nMerkle (left) during Operation Iraqi Freedom\n\nIn 2013, a VA doctor recommended an alternative form of therapy to Merkle: Virtual-reality exposure therapy. \nPioneered in the early '90s, VR exposure therapy aims to treat post-traumatic stress and phobias in a variety of patients (members of the military, sexual assault victims and people who are afraid of heights, just to name a few) by virtually re-creating traumatic memories and asking patients to slowly and continuously work through them with a clinician in a supportive environment. \n\"Done in a safe environment, with a therapist who probes and asks you to re-live and go over and over the trauma, the potency of the fear conditioning diminishes by a process called extinction,\" explains Skip Rizzo, a clinical psychologist and the director of Medical Virtual Reality at the University of Southern California's Institute for Creative Technologies.\n\"Patients start to feel empowerment as they confront and process,\" he adds. \"They're empowered to accept the horrible things and see life ahead.\"\n\nA solider using the Bravemind medical virtual-reality system at USC\n\nAt ICT, Rizzo modeled his VR game, later named Virtual Iraq, after the Xbox game Full Spectrum Warrior. \nAfter more than a decade of trials and tweaks, much of them based on evaluations from military PTS patients and soldiers who brought VR headsets with them to Iraq and Afghanistan to give researchers feedback, Rizzo has been able to recreate 14 virtual worlds and a nearly limitless number of combat scenarios with auditory, visual, kinesthetic and olfactory stimuli. \nIf a veteran wants to work on a scenario where they're sitting in the front seat of an MRAP, for instance, clinicians can place them there and even recreate background noises and vibrations.  \n\"We can never see inside someone's imagination, but we can measure their skin conductance and heart rate,\" Rizzo says. \"When you see someone in traditional therapy who doesn't increase those measures as they share their experiences, there's a failure to engage. It becomes rote.\"\n\"VR is designed to address under-engagers and draw in people who grew up in a digital environment,\" he says.\nIn a 2010 open clinical trial of 20 combat veterans with PTS who completed 10 VR exposure therapy sessions with Rizzo, 16 showed a reduction in symptoms, which they maintained through a three-month follow-up assessment. \nToday, medical VR headsets are used in 75 sites, Rizzo says.\u00a0\nChris Merkle, who began undergoing VR therapy with Rizzo in 2013, says the guided simulations and discussions allowed him to bring his memories into the present, where he can confront them.\n\"I wasn't always able to speak present tense about them,\" he says. \"I was very tactical, but as the sessions moved along, I was able to make it personal and talk about what I\u2019m seeing, feeling, experiencing.\"\n\"I was able to talk through things that I wasn't able to talk about in psychotherapy,\" he says.\nAfter repeatedly recreating and discussing his experiences using VR, Merkle says his attitude and feelings about his time in Iraq changed.\n\"It helped ease my mind and helped me understand that what I was doing was my job and not malice,\" he says.\nBecause of VR, Merkle says that instead of avoiding certain social situations, he's become more outgoing and willing to engage with members of his community.\n\nHuntington Beach, Calif. \n\nRecently, working with the VA and Team Red, White and Blue, a non-profit that works to connect veterans with their communities, Merkle has organized surf camps for veterans in Huntington Beach, California.\nThe events appeal to many of the veterans' competitive and athletic natures, and also gets them talking to one another.\n\"That's four hours where you're not thinking about what's bothering you,\" he says. \"You have to talk to those around you waiting for a wave. For servicemen and women, that's a great opening to talk.\"\nFor Merkle, the surf camps have allowed him to enjoy being home and help other returning veterans adjust to civilian life.\n\"I'm not just reliving the past,\" he says. \"I'm opening myself up and looking where I am now and finding out how I can help my community and myself.\"\nThe ReMotion Knee\nThe $80 prosthetic giving amputees a fresh start\nUsing a prosthetic limb can be debilitating, expensive and, in many countries, humiliating.\nAround the world, more than nine million above-knee amputees don't have access to the prosthetics they need to be healthier and more productive, according to D-Rev, a San Francisco-based non-profit that has been working with researchers since 2008 to develop a more cost-efficient and technologically advanced prosthetic knee.\n\"Development on the prosthetic industry has been focused on the high end of the market, where there's a lot of cool innovation like robotic knees and prosthetics with microprocessors built into them, but there are millions of patients around the world \u2014 especially in developing countries \u2014 who are suffering traumatic amputations because of increased road traffic injuries and poor health care systems,\" says Vinesh Narayan, product manager at D-Rev.\n\"Very little development effort was focused on those patients,\" he adds.\nSince 2008, Narayan and his cohorts in Stanford University's mechanical engineering program have been working with a foot clinic in India (and later patients in Ecuador and Indonesia) to design a prosthetic knee that patients in developing countries can afford and rely on. \nOver time, the device has grown more advanced and user-friendly. \nIt's first iteration, the Jaipur Knee, named after the Indian foot clinic, was given to thousands of patients and meticulously studied by the Stanford students, who at that point had spun it out as their own research project. \nWhile the Jaipur was affordable and dependable (95% of Jaipur Knees did not break, and 79% of patients still use them), D-Rev's goal was always to build the best prosthetic knee on the market \u2014 one that someone living on $4 could afford.\nTo accomplish that goal, researchers gathered data and listened to patient feedback.\u00a0\n\n\nGaurav\u2005standing\u2005with\u2005his\u2005new\u2005ReMotion\u2005Knee at the Jaipur Foot Clinic. \n\nMany Jaipur users, for instance, worked in agriculture and other labor-intensive industries. They required a knee that was durable and not prone to giving out or wobbling. \n\"We wanted to address that shortcoming \u2014 to design a knee that's more stable and allows patients to move quicker and easier with a shorter learning curve,\" Narayan says.\nSocially, D-Rev researchers also heard about the stigmas surrounding disabilities, especially in India. To combat discrimination, they designed a knee that had rounded edges and curved surfaces, so it wouldn't stand out under pants or a dress. \nThey also installed a noise dampener in the prosthetic, so the device wouldn't audibly identify the user as an amputee. \n\"These were things we could only glean from talking to patients and from doing on-the-ground work with them,\" Narayan says.\n\nPrakash,\u200519,\u2005was\u2005fit\u2005with\u2005the\u2005ReMotion\u2005Knee\u2005days\u2005earlier\u2005at\u2005the\u2005Jaipur\u2005Foot\u2005Clinic\u2005in\u2005Jaipur,\u2005India. \n\nThe result of D-Rev's trials and close population studies is the ReMotion Knee.\nAvailable this summer, ReMotion, made out of high-strength polymers and stainless steel, is expected to retail for less than $80.\nThe design is water-resistant, light-weight and capable of moving within a 165-degree range, allowing users to bike, squat and kneel. \nJaipur Knee and ReMotion trial patients have told researchers that their prosthetics have allowed them to regain confidence and, in many cases, return to work and their hobbies and passions. \nJaipur and ReMotion patients in 14 countries have found or returned to work as electricians, storehands, farmers and contractors, D-Rev reports. Others users have returned to college and rejoined prayer groups. \n\"For someone with that type of drive and spirit, they really should have the tools to match their motivation and ability,\" Narayan says.\n\n\n\nPhoto 1\nFlickr/University of Salford Press Office\n\n\nPhoto 2\nFlickr/Waifer X\n\n\nPhoto 3\nPebble/Kristen Regelein\n\n\nPhoto 4\nFlickr/Ike Valdez\n\n\nPhoto 5\nMashable\n\n\nPhoto

To combat discrimination, they designed a knee that had rounded edges and curved surfaces, so it wouldn&#39;t stand out under pants or a dress. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They also installed a noise dampener in the prosthetic, so the device wouldn&#39;t audibly identify the user as an amputee. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\&quot;These were things we could only glean from talking to patients and from doing on-the-ground work with them,\&quot; Narayan says.&lt;/p&gt;&quot;],&quot;extended_options&quot;:{},&quot;id&quot;:&quot;557f88e797b2f82f00005d87&quot;,&quot;id_string&quot;:&quot;19mvevqvk19mvevr0cd0sg&quot;,&quot;template&quot;:&quot;ChapterTextTemplate&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:[],&quot;version&quot;:&quot;0&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:[&quot;Prakash,\u200519,\u2005was\u2005fit\u2005with\u2005the\u2005ReMotion\u2005Knee\u2005days\u2005earlier\u2005at\u2005the\u2005Jaipur\u2005Foot\u2005Clinic\u2005in\u2005Jaipur,\u2005India. &quot;,&quot;&quot;,&quot;&quot;],&quot;extended_options&quot;:{&quot;height_style&quot;:&quot;viewport&quot;,&quot;gallery_mode&quot;:&quot;false&quot;,&quot;mobile_static_fallback&quot;:&quot;true&quot;,&quot;background_breakpoint&quot;:&quot;768&quot;},&quot;id&quot;:&quot;557f88e797b2f82f00005d88&quot;,&quot;id_string&quot;:&quot;19mve1r1g19mve1r2a9k9k&quot;,&quot;template&quot;:&quot;ImageTemplate&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:[&quot;http://1.mshcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/18180297035_1a46b36e3c_o.jpg&quot;],&quot;version&quot;:&quot;0&quot;},{&quot;content&quot;:[&quot;&lt;p&gt;The result of D-Rev&#39;s trials and close population studies is the &lt;a href=\&quot;http://d-rev.org/projects/mobility/\&quot; target=\&quot;_blank\&quot;&gt;ReMotion Knee&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Available this summer, ReMotion, made out of high-strength polymers and stainless steel, is expected to retail for less than $80.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The design is water-resistant, light-weight and capable of moving within a 165-degree range, allowing users to bike, squat and kneel. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jaipur Knee and ReMotion trial patients have told researchers that their prosthetics have allowed them to regain confidence and, in many cases, return to work and their hobbies and passions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jaipur and ReMotion patients in 14 countries have found or returned to work as electricians, storehands, farmers and contractors, D-Rev reports.

target="_blank">Chris Merkle</a> returned home to California after spending most of the prior two decades in Iraq and Afghanistan as a Marine, Army Reservist and private security contractor. </p><p>Going home to the ocean waves he grew up near -- and left at 17 to join the Marines -- brought Merkle comfort, but also uncertainty and uneasiness.</p><p>Now, out of the military and trying to adapt to the slower pace of civilian life, Merkle found himself increasingly startled, irritable and hyper-vigilant, even during his down time. </p><p>At night, he struggled to fall asleep, and, when he finally did go to sleep, he'd have nightmares. </p><p>That cycle would repeat itself as lack of sleep led to more stress, irritability and further sleeplessness.</p><p>"You feel like you’re always reacting," Merkle recalls. "It wears you down. It isn't healthy for your body to stay in a ready state."</p><p>In the years that followed, U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs doctors diagnosed Merkle with post-traumatic stress disorder and prescribed him therapy, but face-to-face counseling wasn't helping him sleep or feel more at ease, he says. </p><p>"I couldn't get past the niceties of psychotherapy," Merkle says.
