Try, But Can't Help Themselves","date":1433522040000,"timestamp":1433522056802,"body":"<p>The average investor doesn&rsquo;t take time out to examine their retirement portfolio every year &ndash; if those investments even exist at all. And why should they, considering how intimidating it all seems. For those who do utilize personal finance and robo-adviser tools, their specific yet evolving, time-sensitive needs can get lost within the full breadth of today&rsquo;s complex investment environment. Unless investors seek help in investigating all investment scenarios and reacting to real-time life changes as they relate to future return, they only see half of what they need to make informed decisions.\r\n\r\nIf you&rsquo;re not advocating for wealth management professional services beyond the basic self-service options on the market, you could be missing out on just as much potential as they may be. A mass market/affluent market of ~13 million households and $7.5trillion+ in investable assets sits in front advisors. Individuals need advice, and you need the solutions to help capture and make sense of their options.\r\n\r\n<img class=\" size-full wp-image-1302\" src=\"http://blogs-images.forbes.com/teradata/files/2015/06/glasses.png\" alt=\"glasses\">\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<b>Offer a partnership that turns around the train of thought</b>\r\n\r\nMore or new is needed from banks and advisors to differentiate themselves as knowledgeable, timely, consultative and customer-centric partners beyond self-service features. This level of personal engagement will help pull the slack out of investor&rsquo;s lack of interaction.\r\n\r\nThe mass-market group is widely varied in age, demographic and preference to how they want to interact. There&rsquo;s a palpable need to make it personal, but you&rsquo;re going to have to do it at scale across your digital channels, otherwise the economics of service don&rsquo;t justify the effort.\r\n\r\n<b>Big data analytics are the new tools of the trade</b>\r\n\r\nOne of the most efficient and results-oriented ways to bring retirement planners (back) into the fold of professional services is by using big data analytics to help them do more than just know how and where to invest, but exactly when they could benefit the most (maybe even before they do).\r\n\nTo better understand your customer base and communicate your benefits more effectively, it&rsquo;s vital to take a deep dive into your data. By analyzing what if, when and how scenarios, you can create predictive engagement models for your advisors, based upon individual client investment, behaviors, life-cycle and needs. Variations yielding more optimal approaches to client engagement can establish ongoing best practices as data is continually updated and shared across the organization. Corporate marketing and cross-channel outreach teams will especially benefit from this level of granular customer data.\r\n\r\nIn addition, your advisor ranks will be competitively armed with alerts and meaningful communications or action steps that can help short circuit client aggravation and confusion in real-time. Advance notification via warning signs can even alert movements or timing where an investor might be veering off track and the implications of those actions. This is where industry professionals will find a significant raison d&rsquo;etre within this newly awakened partnership. The goal in all this, of course, is to offer tailored advice and products in a much larger portfolio by automating client due diligence and communications.\r\n\r\nA pivotal key to survival within the highly competitive banking and investment industry is garnering an edge in identifying marketable consumer benefits at the individual level. There&rsquo;s a wealth of data surrounding the behaviors, preferences and goals of individual customers. But to speak to them at a 1:1, customer-centric level, advanced analytic tools are needed to better identify opportunities to engage at the right time. As stated, those can include potential investment growth &ndash; along with key points within their investment journey to present them in the most meaningful way. &nbsp;But perhaps the most powerful differentiator for your organization will be the ability to engage clients with real-time opportunity associated with small changes to current behaviors that may lead to stronger results. That level of detail is certainly worth the weight of professional wealth management services &nbsp;- and one that will surely separate the haves from the have-nots.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;</p>","description":"The average investor doesn’t take time out to examine their retirement portfolio every year – if those investments even exist at all.

average investor doesn’t take time out to examine their retirement portfolio every year – if those investments even exist at all. And why should they, considering how intimidating it all seems. For those who do utilize personal finance and robo-adviser tools, their specific yet evolving, time-sensitive needs can get lost within the full breadth of today’s complex investment environment. Unless investors seek help in investigating all investment scenarios and reacting to real-time life changes as they relate to future return, they only see half of what they need to make informed decisions.</p>\n<p>If you’re not advocating for wealth management professional services beyond the basic self-service options on the market, you could be missing out on just as much potential as they may be. A mass market/affluent market of ~13 million households and $7.5trillion+ in investable assets sits in front advisors. Individuals need advice, and you need the solutions to help capture and make sense of their options.</p>\n<p><img class=\" size-full wp-image-1302\" src=\"http://blogs-images.forbes.com/teradata/files/2015/06/glasses.png\" alt=\"glasses\" /></p>\n<p><b>Offer a partnership that turns around the train of thought</b></p>\n<p>More or new is needed from banks and advisors to differentiate themselves as knowledgeable, timely, consultative and customer-centric partners beyond self-service features. This level of personal engagement will help pull the slack out of investor’s lack of interaction.</p>\n<p>The mass-market group is widely varied in age, demographic and preference to how they want to interact. There’s a palpable need to make it personal, but you’re going to have to do it at scale across your digital channels, otherwise the economics of service don’t justify the effort.</p>\n<div class=\"vestpocket\" vest-pocket=\"\"></div>\n<p><b>Big data analytics are the new tools of the trade</b></p>\n<p>One of the most efficient and results-oriented ways to bring retirement planners (back) into the fold of professional services is by using big data analytics to help them do more than just know how and where to invest, but exactly when they could benefit the most (maybe even before they do).</p>\n<p>To better understand your customer base and communicate your benefits more effectively, it’s vital to take a deep dive into your data. By analyzing what if, when and how scenarios, you can create predictive engagement models for your advisors, based upon individual client investment, behaviors, life-cycle and needs. Variations yielding more optimal approaches to client engagement can establish ongoing best practices as data is continually updated and shared across the organization. Corporate marketing and cross-channel outreach teams will especially benefit from this level of granular customer data.</p>\n<p>In addition, your advisor ranks will be competitively armed with alerts and meaningful communications or action steps that can help short circuit client aggravation and confusion in real-time. Advance notification via warning signs can even alert movements or timing where an investor might be veering off track and the implications of those actions. This is where industry professionals will find a significant raison d’etre within this newly awakened partnership. The goal in all this, of course, is to offer tailored advice and products in a much larger portfolio by automating client due diligence and communications.</p>\n<p>A pivotal key to survival within the highly competitive banking and investment industry is garnering an edge in identifying marketable consumer benefits at the individual level. There’s a wealth of data surrounding the behaviors, preferences and goals of individual customers. But to speak to them at a 1:1, customer-centric level, advanced analytic tools are needed to better identify opportunities to engage at the right time. As stated, those can include potential investment growth – along with key points within their investment journey to present them in the most meaningful way. &nbsp;But perhaps the most powerful differentiator for your organization will be the ability to engage clients with real-time opportunity associated with small changes to current behaviors that may lead to stronger results. That level of detail is certainly worth the weight of professional wealth management services &nbsp;- and one that will surely separate the haves from the have-nots.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>"],"disableDigest":false,"writtenByForbesStaff":false,"channelSectionMappings":[{"id":"channel_1","channelName":"Business","url":"/business"},{"id":"channel_3","channelName":"Tech","url":"/technology"},{"id":"channel_6","channelName":"Leadership","url":"/leadership"}],"individualAuthor":{"naturalId":"blogAuthorId/blog/author/1738430","name":"Sean O'Dowd","avatars":[{"size":40,"image":"http://blogs-images.forbes.com/files/2015/06/seanodowd_avatar_1433521770-40x40.jpg"},{"size":62,"image":"http://blogs-images.forbes.com/files/2015/06/seanodowd_avatar_1433521770-62x62.jpg"},{"size":136,"image":"http://blogs-images.forbes.com/files/2015/06/seanodowd_avatar_1433521770-136x136.jpg"},{"size":400,"image":"http://blogs-images.forbes.com/files/2015/06/seanodowd_avatar_1433521770.jpg"}],"url":"http://www.forbes.com/sites/teradata/","type":"AdVoice","profileUrl":"/sites/teradata/people/seanodowd/","authorType":"ad","email":"soonbv12@mail.com","tagName":"Big Data to Data-Driven Insights","blog":false,"numFollowers":0,"advoiceBrand":"Teradata","timestamp":1445791457752,"description":"As Global Director of Capital Markets at Teradata for Industry Marketing, Sean O’Dowd focuses on industry strategy, marketing and field enablement.
