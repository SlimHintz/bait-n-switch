Face A Revenue Problem","date":1434031260000,"timestamp":1434031298279,"body":"<p class=\"p1\">Ever wonder why messaging&nbsp;apps&nbsp;like LINE, WeChat, Kik, Snapchat and Facebook Messenger have&nbsp;started&nbsp;broadening into&nbsp;all manner of other services, from ordering groceries to sending money to hailing a cab? It's&nbsp;because it's so hard&nbsp;to&nbsp;make money&nbsp;from simply&nbsp;letting people send texts for&nbsp;free.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">The&nbsp;global&nbsp;business of messaging, including&nbsp;the&nbsp;traditional SMS business of carriers&nbsp;and free texting from over-the-top players like WhatsApp, is set to shrink over the next few years,&nbsp;from $113.5 billion in 2014 to $112.9 billion in 2019, according to&nbsp;Juniper Research, a market-research firm based in Basingstoke, England.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">Chat&nbsp;traffic will meanwhile triple&nbsp;on messaging&nbsp;apps to&nbsp;100 trillion messages in&nbsp;2019.&nbsp;\"Revenues won&rsquo;t grow at the same pace,\" writes Juniper analyst Lauren Foye&nbsp;in a recent report on the future of&nbsp;messaging&nbsp;app.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">In a nutshell, lots of chat traffic doesn&rsquo;t directly translate to&nbsp;lots of revenue, and that will continue to be the case for the next few years.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">The irony is that modern-day chat apps which disrupted the SMS businesses of carriers by running on top of their infrastructure -- and eclipsed the global number of SMS's being sent around the world in 2012&nbsp;with&nbsp;their&nbsp;own free-message traffic --&nbsp;are being similarly exploited by their own users.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">In fact, for all the disruption that the humble SMS has been through, it's still the only mobile texting&nbsp;product that will make any money in the foreseeable&nbsp;future.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">Revenue from texting on chat apps like WhatsApp and LINE will make up just 1% of all the revenue generated by SMS and chat traffic in 2019, according to Juniper. The vast majority of the $113 billion in revenue from mobile chatting will still come from sending traditional SMS over carrier networks.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">In Asia, messaging apps like WeChat, LINE and KakaoTalk&nbsp;are the most advanced in the world in broadening&nbsp;out into&nbsp;extra services. This&nbsp;slide from Mary Meeker's 2015 Internet trend reports illustrates just how many areas&nbsp;they have&nbsp;branched into:</p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><img class=\" size-full wp-image-14234\" src=\"http://blogs-images.forbes.com/parmyolson/files/2015/06/Messaging-apps-revenue.png\" alt=\"Messaging apps revenue\"></p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">Yet&nbsp;their attempts to make money from advertising at scale -- the traditional business model for&nbsp;desktop&nbsp;kings&nbsp;Facebook and Google --&nbsp;has also been tricky because of&nbsp;a &ldquo;<span class=\"s1\">limited acceptance [of advertising] by consumers&rdquo;</span> who use these apps, according to Foye.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">Asian chat apps do make money from ads but in order to get decent click-through rates from users, those ads need to be of a particularly high quality, according to Juniper, which is more costly.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">The&nbsp;result is a tricky path to revenue that requires the pioneering of&nbsp;bold, and sometimes&nbsp;unusual strategies. Around 20% of LINE&rsquo;s revenue <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/duncanclark/2014/03/26/whatsapp-in-asia-wechat-line-embrace-ads-games-and-gimmicks/2/\">comes from sales of digital stickers</a>, for instance, while&nbsp;60% reportedly <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2015/01/28/naver-line-4q2014/\">comes from games</a>.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">Even so, LINE&rsquo;s latest quarterly results fell below expectations because of a <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2015/01/28/naver-line-4q2014/\">weaker</a> revenues from the company's&nbsp;gaming unit, and its net profit for the year 2014 also fell by almost 76%.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">Tencent&rsquo;s WeChat has had <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2014/11/12/tencent-3q2014/\">similar troubles</a> recently.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_14236\" align=\"\" width=\"700\"]<img class=\"size-full wp-image-14236\" src=\"http://blogs-images.forbes.com/parmyolson/files/2015/06/Screen-Shot-2015-06-11-at-14.24.05.png\" alt=\"Revenue from texting on chat apps will make up just 1% of all the revenue generated by SMS and chat traffic in 2019. Source: Juniper Research\"> Revenue from texting on chat apps will make up just 1% of all the revenue generated by SMS and chat traffic in 2019. Source: Juniper Research[/caption]\r\n<p class=\"p1\">The fix to finding new sources of revenue&nbsp;clearly isn't with&nbsp;ads, which are less cost effective anyway than in the West, but with&nbsp;more in-app purchases and payment services like LINE Pay and Snapchat&rsquo;s Snap&nbsp;Cash.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">One bright light for chat&nbsp;revenues&nbsp;is that while they will&nbsp;decline on the whole over the next four years, one area that will go against that trend according to Juniper is when businesses send&nbsp;messages to users.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">Juniper refers to this as A2P, or application-to-person, and it&rsquo;s already being put into practice by chat apps Kik and Facebook Messenger.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">&ldquo;<span class=\"s2\">This trend will largely be driven by the desire by banks, financial institutions and security firms for the reliability and security which A2P messaging provides,</span>&rdquo; says Foye.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">Around 10 million of Kik&rsquo;s mostly-young users, for example, <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/parmyolson/2015/05/29/kiks-messaging-bots-brands/\">have held conversation with chat bots</a> controlled by advertisers like Skullcandy and Funny Or&nbsp;Die.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">Facebook Messenger&nbsp;also&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/ryanmac/2015/03/25/facebook-goes-all-in-on-e-commerce-by-bringing-businesses-onto-messenger/\">recently invited</a> businesses to set up accounts on Facebook Messenger to also chat with users. Clothing site Overland and deals site Zulily are the first to try the platform out.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">WhatsApp, the biggest mobile messenger&nbsp;in the world with 800 million monthly active users&nbsp; has also said in the past that it plans to monetize itself by allowing companies to send &ldquo;commercial messages&rdquo; to users, but it has yet to put that plan into motion publicly.</p>","description":"They’re racing to become mobile platforms of the future because they can barely make a dime from messaging alone.","image":"http://blogs-images.forbes.com/parmyolson/files/2015/06/Zuckerberg-e1434029890554-300x169.jpg","type":"blog","storyType":"post","uri":"http://www.forbes.com/sites/parmyolson/2015/06/11/messaging-apps-wechat-whatsapp-facebook-revenue-problem/","comments":[],"visible":true,"promotedChannelSections":[{"channel":"channel_3","section":"","title":"Messaging Apps Like LINE, WeChat Face A Revenue Problem","description":"They’re racing to become mobile platforms of the future because they can barely make a dime from messaging alone.","image":"/images/channels/channel_3_panel594_0_bigsquare-1434035447.jpg","location":"top"}],"blogId":"1011","authors":[{"naturalId":"blogAuthorId/blog/author/81","name":"Parmy Olson","avatars":[{"size":136,"image":"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/729760248524d762af3a6f936f9aea27?s=136&amp;d=http%3A%2F%2F1.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2Fad516503a11cd5ca435acc9bb6523536%3Fs%3D136&amp;r=G"},{"size":40,"image":"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/729760248524d762af3a6f936f9aea27?s=40&amp;d=http%3A%2F%2F1.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2Fad516503a11cd5ca435acc9bb6523536%3Fs%3D40&amp;r=G"},{"size":400,"image":"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/729760248524d762af3a6f936f9aea27?s=400&amp;d=http%3A%2F%2F1.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2Fad516503a11cd5ca435acc9bb6523536%3Fs%3D400&amp;r=G"},{"size":62,"image":"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/729760248524d762af3a6f936f9aea27?s=62&amp;d=http%3A%2F%2F1.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2Fad516503a11cd5ca435acc9bb6523536%3Fs%3D62&amp;r=G"}],"url":"http://www.forbes.com/sites/parmyolson/","type":"Forbes Staff","profileUrl":"/sites/parmyolson/","twitterName":"parmy","authorType":"individual","facebookName":"parmyolson","email":"polson@forbes.com","blog":false,"numFollowers":0,"shortBio":"I cover agitators and innovators in mobile.","amazon":"http://www.amazon.com/We-Are-Anonymous-LulzSec-Insurgency/dp/0316213543/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1334937485&sr=8-2","timestamp":1445791199071,"description":"I track people who are disrupting the world of mobile technology.

It’s&nbsp;because it’s so hard&nbsp;to&nbsp;make money&nbsp;from simply&nbsp;letting people send texts for&nbsp;free.</p>\n<p>The&nbsp;global&nbsp;business of messaging, including&nbsp;the&nbsp;traditional SMS business of carriers&nbsp;and free texting from over-the-top players like WhatsApp, is set to shrink over the next few years,&nbsp;from $113.5 billion in 2014 to $112.9 billion in 2019, according to&nbsp;Juniper Research, a market-research firm based in Basingstoke, England.</p>\n<p>Chat&nbsp;traffic will meanwhile triple&nbsp;on messaging&nbsp;apps to&nbsp;100 trillion messages in&nbsp;2019.&nbsp;”Revenues won’t grow at the same pace,” writes Juniper analyst Lauren Foye&nbsp;in a recent report on the future of&nbsp;messaging&nbsp;app.</p>\n<p>In a nutshell, lots of chat traffic doesn’t directly translate to&nbsp;lots of revenue, and that will continue to be the case for the next few years.</p>\n<p>The irony is that modern-day chat apps which disrupted the SMS businesses of carriers by running on top of their infrastructure — and eclipsed the global number of SMS’s being sent around the world in 2012&nbsp;with&nbsp;their&nbsp;own free-message traffic –&nbsp;are being similarly exploited by their own users.</p>\n<div id=\"inread\" article-ad-inbody=\"inread\" class=\"inread\"></div>\n<p>In fact, for all the disruption that the humble SMS has been through, it’s still the only mobile texting&nbsp;product that will make any money in the foreseeable&nbsp;future.</p>\n<p>Revenue from texting on chat apps like WhatsApp and LINE will make up just 1% of all the revenue generated by SMS and chat traffic in 2019, according to Juniper. The vast majority of the $113 billion in revenue from mobile chatting will still come from sending traditional SMS over carrier networks.</p>\n<p>In Asia, messaging apps like WeChat, LINE and KakaoTalk&nbsp;are the most advanced in the world in broadening&nbsp;out into&nbsp;extra services. This&nbsp;slide from Mary Meeker’s 2015 Internet trend reports illustrates just how many areas&nbsp;they have&nbsp;branched into:</p>\n<div class=\"vestpocket\" vest-pocket=\"\"></div>\n<p><img class=\" size-full wp-image-14234\" src=\"http://blogs-images.forbes.com/parmyolson/files/2015/06/Messaging-apps-revenue.png\" alt=\"Messaging apps revenue\" /></p>\n<p>Yet&nbsp;their attempts to make money from advertising at scale — the traditional business model for&nbsp;desktop&nbsp;kings&nbsp;Facebook and Google –&nbsp;has also been tricky because of&nbsp;a “<span class=\"s1\">limited acceptance [of advertising] by consumers”</span> who use these apps, according to Foye.</p>\n<p>Asian chat apps do make money from ads but in order to get decent click-through rates from users, those ads need to be of a particularly high quality, according to Juniper, which is more costly.</p>\n<p>The&nbsp;result is a tricky path to revenue that requires the pioneering of&nbsp;bold, and sometimes&nbsp;unusual strategies. Around 20% of LINE’s revenue <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/duncanclark/2014/03/26/whatsapp-in-asia-wechat-line-embrace-ads-games-and-gimmicks/2/\" target=\"_self\">comes from sales of digital stickers</a>, for instance, while&nbsp;60% reportedly <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2015/01/28/naver-line-4q2014/\">comes from games</a>.</p>\n<p>Even so, LINE’s latest quarterly results fell below expectations because of a <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2015/01/28/naver-line-4q2014/\">weaker</a> revenues from the company’s&nbsp;gaming unit, and its net profit for the year 2014 also fell by almost 76%.</p>\n<p>Tencent’s WeChat has had <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2014/11/12/tencent-3q2014/\">similar troubles</a> recently.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_14236\"> \n <img class=\"size-full wp-image-14236\" src=\"http://blogs-images.forbes.com/parmyolson/files/2015/06/Screen-Shot-2015-06-11-at-14.24.05.png\" alt=\"Revenue from texting on chat apps will make up just 1% of all the revenue generated by SMS and chat traffic in 2019.
