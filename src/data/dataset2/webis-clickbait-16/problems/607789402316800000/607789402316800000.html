Scared","date":1433513400000,"timestamp":1439584013717,"body":"<em>By Sarah McMullin, Director, Emerging Technologies, SAP</em>\r\n\r\nAre you sure the salmon you are eating and paying a premium for is actually Atlantic salmon versus Pacific? How certain do you think food retailers are?\r\n\r\nThe U.S. Grocery Manufacturers Association (GMA) estimates that food fraud costs the global food industry between $10 - $15 billion annually, affecting 10% of all commercially sold food products.\r\n\r\nFood fraud is the act of defrauding food buyers for economic gain, like substituting Pacific salmon for Atlantic salmon, or diluting ingredients like adding other oils to \"extra virgin\" olive oil. Recently, the New York Attorney General sent cease and desist letters to major retailers for selling fraudulent herbal supplements based on DNA testing, demanding they remove the products from their shelves.\r\n\r\nI love disruptive innovations - and<strong> DNA testing to detect food fraud</strong> is truly that. Clayton Christensen (a famous <a href='http://www.forbes.com/colleges/harvard-university/harvard-business-school/'>Harvard Business School</a> professor) is the father of this phrase and defined a great model to characterize the path these disruptive innovations take.&nbsp; This model can also illuminate how far we have come with DNA testing to detect food fraud.\r\n\r\n<img class=\" size-full wp-image-28222\" src=\"http://blogs-images.forbes.com/sap/files/2015/06/shutterstock_250375243.jpg\" alt=\"shutterstock_250375243\">\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>A disruptive innovation </strong>begins with simple applications or services at the bottom of a market.&nbsp; Today we use DNA testing to answer the simplest of questions in food supply: Is there pork in this product?&nbsp; Conversely, if we expect pork in a product that contains none, we can also ask <em>what exactly is this product?</em>\r\n\r\nThis type of questioning opens the market up to a <strong>new group of consumers</strong> that could not otherwise access it due to lack of money or skill. This is where we thrive within Emerging Technologies department at SAP.&nbsp; We have already unlocked these capabilities&nbsp;to citizen scientists via the <span style=\"color: #3366ff\"><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/lifescanner/id875084436?mt=8\" rel=\"nofollow\" ><span style=\"color: #3366ff\">free LifeScanner mobile application</span></a></span> built in cooperation with the Barcode of Life organization. But we&rsquo;re not stopping there.\r\n\r\nWe are working to make this technology available to Enterprises as well. What once was thought of as something that only PHDs in lab coats could do, I can confidently state we (meaning technologists, not scientists) can perform these types of tests using incredibly intuitive hardware and software.\r\n\r\nDisruptive innovation also offers lower profit margins per unit sold and attracts smaller markets than established competitors. I think we are at this stage now, <strong>attracting early</strong> <strong>adopters</strong>, those that want to reduce costly recalls, protect their brands, increase consumer confidence and ultimately pay the fair price for the food they source.\r\n\r\nRest assured, it&rsquo;s only a matter of time before disruptive innovation in food safety moves upstream to shake up the status quo.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;","description":"By Sarah McMullin, Director, Emerging Technologies, SAP Are you sure the salmon you are eating and paying a premium for is actually Atlantic salmon versus Pacific?

Sarah McMullin, Director, Emerging Technologies, SAP</em></p>\n<p>Are you sure the salmon you are eating and paying a premium for is actually Atlantic salmon versus Pacific? How certain do you think food retailers are?</p>\n<p>The U.S. Grocery Manufacturers Association (GMA) estimates that food fraud costs the global food industry between $10 – $15 billion annually, affecting 10% of all commercially sold food products.</p>\n<p>Food fraud is the act of defrauding food buyers for economic gain, like substituting Pacific salmon for Atlantic salmon, or diluting ingredients like adding other oils to “extra virgin” olive oil. Recently, the New York Attorney General sent cease and desist letters to major retailers for selling fraudulent herbal supplements based on DNA testing, demanding they remove the products from their shelves.</p>\n<p>I love disruptive innovations – and<strong> DNA testing to detect food fraud</strong> is truly that. Clayton Christensen (a famous <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/colleges/harvard-university/harvard-business-school/\" target=\"_self\">Harvard Business School</a> professor) is the father of this phrase and defined a great model to characterize the path these disruptive innovations take.&nbsp; This model can also illuminate how far we have come with DNA testing to detect food fraud.</p>\n<p><img class=\" size-full wp-image-28222\" src=\"http://blogs-images.forbes.com/sap/files/2015/06/shutterstock_250375243.jpg\" alt=\"shutterstock_250375243\" /></p>\n<p><strong>A disruptive innovation </strong>begins with simple applications or services at the bottom of a market.&nbsp; Today we use DNA testing to answer the simplest of questions in food supply: Is there pork in this product?&nbsp; Conversely, if we expect pork in a product that contains none, we can also ask <em>what exactly is this product?</em></p>\n<div class=\"vestpocket\" vest-pocket=\"\"></div>\n<p>This type of questioning opens the market up to a <strong>new group of consumers</strong> that could not otherwise access it due to lack of money or skill. This is where we thrive within Emerging Technologies department at SAP.&nbsp; We have already unlocked these capabilities&nbsp;to citizen scientists via the <span style=\"color: #3366ff\"><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/lifescanner/id875084436?mt=8\" rel=\"nofollow\"><span style=\"color: #3366ff\">free LifeScanner mobile application</span></a></span> built in cooperation with the Barcode of Life organization. But we’re not stopping there.</p>\n<p>We are working to make this technology available to Enterprises as well. What once was thought of as something that only PHDs in lab coats could do, I can confidently state we (meaning technologists, not scientists) can perform these types of tests using incredibly intuitive hardware and software.</p>\n<p>Disruptive innovation also offers lower profit margins per unit sold and attracts smaller markets than established competitors. I think we are at this stage now, <strong>attracting early</strong> <strong>adopters</strong>, those that want to reduce costly recalls, protect their brands, increase consumer confidence and ultimately pay the fair price for the food they source.</p>\n<p>Rest assured, it’s only a matter of time before disruptive innovation in food safety moves upstream to shake up the status quo.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>"],"disableDigest":false,"writtenByForbesStaff":false,"channelSectionMappings":[{"id":"channel_1","channelName":"Business","url":"/business"},{"id":"channel_8section_333","channelName":"Lists","sectionName":"America's Richest Families","url":"/ebooks/americas-richest-families/"}],"digestDisabled":false,"brandVoiceTitle":"DNA Testing Has Food Fraud Running Scared","groupAuthor":{"naturalId":"blogAuthorId/blog/author/blog-1194","name":"SAP","avatars":[{"size":40,"image":"http://blogs-images.forbes.com/assets/images/avatars/blog-1194_40.jpg"},{"size":62,"image":"http://blogs-images.forbes.com/assets/images/avatars/blog-1194_62.jpg"},{"size":136,"image":"http://blogs-images.forbes.com/assets/images/avatars/blog-1194_136.jpg"},{"size":400,"image":"http://blogs-images.forbes.com/assets/images/avatars/blog-1194_400.jpg"}],"url":"http://www.forbes.com/sites/sap/","type":"AdVoice","profileUrl":"http://blogs.forbes.com/sap/profile/","twitterName":"sap","authorType":"ad","tagName":"RUN SIMPLE","blog":true,"numFollowers":0,"webSite":"http://scn.sap.com/community/business-trends","advoiceBrand":"SAP","timestamp":1445791464288,"description":"SAP is the world’s leading provider of business software – enterprise resource planning, business intelligence, and related applications and services that help companies of all sizes and in more than 25 industries run better.
