Boston University, recently sat down with me to discuss the present state of Social Security. Larry talks about how overly complicated it has become and provides tips for how you can get the most from your benefits. Larry co-wrote the best-selling book Get What's Yours: The Secrets To Maxing Out Your Social Security. Video and transcript follows.</em>\r\n\r\n[brightcove videoID=4283895840001 playerID=]\r\n\r\n<strong>Steve Forbes: </strong>Laurence Kotlikoff, thank you very much for joining us today. We're going to discuss your book, <em>Get What's Yours,</em> which is now a bestseller. You know, once upon a time concerning Social Security, we all thought if you took it at 62 you'd get less than you would at 66 or 70. So the longer you waited, the more you got, and that's that. And your wife would get something. If you're disabled, you might get something. But pretty simple. We all know the federal income tax code is a horror. I can tell you the federal election laws are a horror. But whoever would have thought something seemingly as simple as Social Security would be so gosh darn complex. Hence, the need for this book.\r\n\r\n<strong>Larry Kotlikoff:</strong> Well, Steve, thanks for having me. And the system is incredibly complicated. There are 2,728 rules in their handbook. And there's literally hundreds of thousands of rules about those 2,728 rules in what's called their program operating manual system. And all these rules and rules about the rules are written in geek. That's not Greek, it's geek, a language that nobody can understand.\r\n\r\nSo people are flying blind when it comes to collecting Social Security. There's more than one benefit to be collected. There's not just your retirement benefit. There are actually 12 different benefits that you can collect. Parent benefits. Child benefits. Spouse benefits, as you mentioned. Widow benefits. Divorcee benefits for spouses and for widows. And it goes on.\r\n\r\n<strong>Forbes:</strong> So, you say that just as one little example, Americans leave $10 billion in unclaimed spousal benefits on the table each year. $10 billion?\r\n<strong>Kotlikoff:</strong> Yeah, that's a lot of money.\r\n\r\n<strong>Forbes:</strong> It's just the beginning.\r\n<strong>Kotlikoff:</strong> It's the beginning. And people that don't know what they're doing could inadvertently lose their spousal benefit, because Social Security has this gotcha that if you try and take two benefits at once, you'll get the larger of the two. So one will wipe out the other. So the key to collecting a spousal benefit is to collect it by itself and let your retirement benefit grow. This is actually how the book got initiated.\r\n\r\nMy tennis partner, Paul Solman, who's the <em>PBS News Hour</em> economics correspondent&hellip; we were taking a break from tennis because he was beating me. I needed a rest. I started asking him when he's going to take Social Security. And he says, \"Don't bother me. I've got it all figured out.\" I kept pushing him on this, and within a couple minutes I had made him $50,000 and forced him to buy me dinner, just in free spousal benefits.\r\n<!--nextpage-->\nAnd the trick in his case was, his wife had to permit him to get a spousal benefit by filing for her own retirement benefit, suspending its collection so she could wait until 70 to get her retirement benefit. And then he went and collected just his spousal benefit and waited until 70 to collect his retirement benefit.\r\n\r\n<strong>Forbes:</strong> Already getting complicated. So it's fair to say we have a system today that randomly redistributes between those who know the rules and those who don't?\r\n<strong>Kotlikoff:</strong> Yeah. We're very concerned in this country about inequality. And this is really outrageous. The fact that our basic saving system is so user unfriendly that some people who pay the same taxes potentially get very different outcomes because they don't understand the rules. So that's really one of the big motivations for writing the book.\r\n\r\n<strong>Forbes:</strong> So how did it become so complex? Something seemingly basic. We all think of Franklin Roosevelt and Ida Fuller. You just put the money in and collect it. How did it become so IRS-like?\r\n<strong>Kotlikoff:</strong> Well, we tend in our country not to start from scratch to fix things or redesign things. We just start to add on things. So over the years they added spousal benefits and survivor benefits and disability benefits. And the bureaucrats just had a field day. They just went crazy and decided that they were the social gods.\r\n\r\nThey would decide who would get what, if they did it exactly this way. And if they didn't get it exactly right, they would not get whatever it was that could be gotten. So this is really a bureaucrat's paradise, this system. And it's a national disgrace. I'm not opposed to Social Security; I want to point out. I think that we should be forcing people to save and forcing them to have disability and life insurance and longevity insurance. But the way this is structured is just really unbelievable.\r\n\r\n<strong>Forbes:</strong> Does Congress have any real idea of what the system really is?\r\n<strong>Kotlikoff:</strong> Well, I've been encouraging people to buy a copy of the book for their members of Congress and also call up their congressman and ask them what they should do, in terms of their benefit collection, just to drive the members of Congress crazy to the point where they actually realize what it is that they created. They created a monster here over the years. And they need to fix it. We can't sentence every generation to come along to deal with a system that's this complicated and awful.\r\n\r\n<strong>Forbes:</strong> You make the point going to the Social Security Administration&mdash;good people though they may be&mdash;that's the last point you want to go to get sound advice.\r\n<strong>Kotlikoff:</strong> Yeah. I would say about 40% of the time the people at Social Security are giving you the wrong answer. Either 100% wrong or partially wrong, or they're not really thinking through carefully your situation. I'll give you an example. I've got a gentleman I met at a dinner party recently. He's a doctor in Boston. He's 68. He was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. So he hadn't taken Social Security.\r\n\r\nAnd he told me that he went to Social Security. And they said, \"Well you need to take the benefit right away, because gee, you're about to die, and you'll at least get something.\" And that's what he did. And they even gave him benefits retroactively for six months. He thought that was the right thing to do. Now, I started asking him about his wife. Turns out, his wife is 65. And she didn't have much of an earnings history. So what they told him to do was the wrong thing, because they didn't ask him about his wife or her earnings history.\r\n\r\nAnd the best thing for him to do was wait until 70 and see if he made it that long, because if he makes it until 70, her widow's benefit will be 16% higher for the entire rest of her life. She could make it to 100. Every month, she'll have a 16% higher check to open because he did the right thing, which was different from what they advised. So he's actually able to undo what they did, because he has a year to withdraw his decision and then start from scratch. And that's what he's doing.\r\n<!--nextpage-->\n<strong>Forbes:</strong> Just one example&hellip;each week, for PBS and for Forbes, you take a question like the old Dear Abby and give an answer. This one individual asks, \"I'll be 66 October 3rd. Quit my full-time job December 31.\" And then, I'm not going to read the whole question, but just the answer tells you all you need to know. This is what you say: \"In my answer, I'm going to assume you can't collect spousal, widow's, divorcee spousal or divorcee widow's benefits. In other words, I'm going to assume you were never married or were married for less than ten years before getting divorced. Under these assumptions, your best course is to wait until then you go and give the answer. That scrambles the brain.\r\n<strong>Kotlikoff:</strong> Yeah. You know, the curious thing is it's really a Sudoku puzzle, this system. And a lot of people are reading this column, even after they figure out what to do for themselves because they find it interesting to solve the puzzle. They want to learn the rules so that they can figure out for the next person whether they read about it, can they guess the answer before I give the answer? And that's the funny thing. But it's not really a joke or a puzzle. It's really sad that every answer with Social Security begins and ends with a \"but.\" You know, \"Do this, but. If you're in this situation, it's different.\"\r\n\r\n<strong>Forbes:</strong> So you point out that we all think the risk for Social Security is your friend with the pancreatic cancer, \"I better take it now, because I might not be around to get it. And I've spent a whole lifetime putting money in. Nothing's going to be there.\" You make the point, though, that for all the travails of old age, the real risk is the risk of living.\r\n<strong>Kotlikoff:</strong> Yeah. Because, you know, we're all fixated on death and illness surrounding death. And that's our focus. And Social Security for years was telling people they should take their money right away so that they can get something before they die. And we're all sure that we're going to die on time. But, as you just indicated, there's just no guarantee you're going to die on time. The real risk from life is not dying, because you get to go to Heaven if you die. The real risk is living to 100 and not having the means to sustain yourself.\r\n\r\nSo if you're this very simple case of somebody who's 62 and you have the option of waiting until 70, they can take a 76% higher benefit adjusted for inflation if they wait till 70. And that will continue right up to 100 or whatever, 110 if they live that long. And that's really insurance, longevity insurance. It's dealing with the worst-case scenario, which in this case is living. It's not dying.\r\n\r\n<strong>Forbes:</strong> It's the ultimate annuity.\r\n<strong>Kotlikoff:</strong> Yeah, it's an annuity. It's exactly that longevity insurance. And that has tremendous value to people if they understand what's involved here. So we push that point very strongly in the book, in the second chapter, actually.\r\n\r\n<strong>Forbes:</strong> So you have three general rules.\r\n<strong>Kotlikoff:</strong> The three general rules are: be patient because there is this huge pay-off built into the system from waiting. It's not true for everybody, but everybody should be patient, because in some cases you want to take your benefit early in order to enable benefits for your kids or spouse or both. But in general, patience is going to pay off. Then, you want to be aware of all the benefits.\r\n\r\n<strong>Forbes:</strong> That's like marriage. Be patient.\r\n<strong>Kotlikoff:</strong> Right. Exactly. And then, you want to be aware of all the benefits. And then, the third thing is you need to strategize. You need to time your benefit collection so that one doesn't wipe out the other. Because again, you can't get two at once, two benefits at once. They'll give you just the larger of the two. So the general idea is to take one benefit early and let the other one grow and then take that.\r\n\r\n<strong>Forbes:</strong> So for people to begin to understand this thing, this new world&hellip; file and suspend, maybe unsuspend. Walk us through that.\r\n<strong>Kotlikoff:</strong> Okay. We call this start, stop, start. Start your benefit, stop it, and start it up again. So I'll give you an example of a real case. A 62-year-old gentleman who's married to a 45-year-old wife whose child is disabled and was disabled before age 22.\r\n\r\nSo if he starts his benefit early, he can therefore get a child benefit going for his child and also what's called a \"child in care\" spouse benefit for his wife. She was working, but now she's stopped working. She's going to watch over the child. And he has the option at full retirement at age 66 in his case to suspend his benefit and start it up again at 70. And it's not just special for him. Anybody who's started their benefit early can suspend it once they reach full retirement age or any time after full retirement age, up to 70. And then start it up at 70 again at a higher level. It's 8% per year for every year that you suspend.\r\n<!--nextpage-->\n<strong>Forbes:</strong> So at 62, you can&hellip;\r\n<strong>Kotlikoff:</strong> Suspend it at 66, and then at 70, you start it at 32% higher.\r\n\r\n<strong>Forbes:</strong> So if you start at 62, you take benefits. And then suspend the benefit.\r\n<strong>Kotlikoff:</strong> You suspend the benefit. You go into Social Security, and you say, \"I'd like to suspend my benefit.\" And if you talk to the right person, they will understand that's an option. And, if not, you go talk to a different person. After you read the book, you see this is actually what you can do. And then at 70, you start it up again at a 32% higher number. So every year from 70 to maybe 100, you're opening a 32% higher check.\r\n\r\nAnyway, you've sacrificed your own benefits&mdash; this gentleman has&mdash;because they're going to start this lower level retirement benefit because he took his benefit early at a 32% higher level. That's going to be a benefit starting from 70 that's lower than had he never taken anything and waited just until 70. But he's taken a hit on his benefits, but he's produced higher benefits for his wife and his child.\r\n\r\nAnd, in that case, it turns out that there are about ten different benefits this household has to collect through time. Because the child first collects on the dad. Then when the mom takes her retirement benefits, since she had a higher earnings history, he collects on her. Then the dad dies. He collects a child survivor benefit on the dad, because that's larger than the child benefit. And then he collects on the mom. It goes like that. That's the case.\r\n\r\n<strong>Forbes:</strong> So when these rules are changed, do they have public hearings? Or how are these things conjured up?\r\n<strong>Kotlikoff:</strong> Well, I'll tell you kind of a sad story here. We wrote in the book that disabled people could get free spousal benefits by withdrawing their immediate conversion of their disability benefit at full retirement age into a retirement benefit; that they could withdraw that conversion and then just file for a spousal benefit by itself. And then take their retirement benefit at its highest value at 70. So that they would have the same potential as married people or divorced people to get a full spousal benefit.\r\n\r\nAnd that's in the book. And then on December 23, right before Christmas, some bureaucrat in Social Security changed the provision in this huge program operating manual system rules that denied the disabled this right. So they deprived millions of disabled people in the course of a couple sentences from the ability to do what the law clearly allowed them to do. It's outrageous, but these people are legislating benefits on their own. These bureaucrats think it's in their power. And I wrote about it. And it really is outrageous that they did this. It's discriminatory.\r\n\r\n<strong>Forbes:</strong> Was that the do-over?\r\n<strong>Kotlikoff:</strong> That was not the do-over.\r\n\r\n<strong>Forbes:</strong> What was the do-over?\r\n<strong>Kotlikoff:</strong> The do-over was that, thanks to Janet Novack from Forbes, I learned about the ability to withdraw your retirement benefit really at any time. Pay back what you had received, without any interest, and start from scratch. And I wrote about it. Janet wrote about it. Others wrote about it.\r\n<!--nextpage-->\nAnd, at some point, Social Security changed the law and said that you can't do this beyond one year. You can withdraw your filling for your retirement benefit, but you only have a year to do it. It used to be unlimited. So that changed as well, just by somebody at Social Security by decree. I think that had more sense. That wasn't really so much discriminating against people. But this thing with disability, I think is really lousy.\r\n\r\n<strong>Forbes:</strong> Deeming rules. What are deeming rules?\r\n<strong>Kotlikoff:</strong> So one of the things we have in the book is a list of 25 'gotchas,'&mdash;the worst gotchas in Social Security. Deeming is maybe the worst. Here's the deal: Steve, you and I are both married. We're both 60. Maybe you're 66. You filed for your retirement benefit. And maybe you're 70 when you filed for your retirement benefit.\r\n\r\nAnd so now, I'm in a position to file for my spousal benefit. So because you're my spouse and all you have to do is have filed for your retirement benefit. So if I file before full retirement age for my spousal benefit thinking I can wait to collect my own retirement benefit at 70, no. Because what happens is, if I do it before full retirement age, I'm going to be deemed to also be filing for my retirement benefit.\r\n\r\nAnd then they're going to give me the larger of the two. And that would most likely be my retirement benefit, which means my spousal benefit which I filed for, which I wanted to get is going to be wiped out forever. And then I'm going to be left with a permanently reduced retirement benefit. So it's really a double whammy. That's deeming.\r\n\r\nIf you try and take your spousal benefit early, you're forced to take your retirement benefit early. If you take your retirement benefit early, you're forced to take your spousal benefit early. That's one of the things we warn people to be careful about.\r\n\r\n<strong>Forbes:</strong> Amazing. So things that this now crazy system encourages: Divorce.\r\n<strong>Kotlikoff:</strong> Divorce, yeah. It turns out that only one of two spouses in a marriage can get a full spousal benefit. Again, if they play their cards right in terms of the timing and everything. But if you get divorced, both spouses can get a full spousal benefit. So if you got divorced two years before you reach full retirement age, you could then live in sin and you both could collect a full spousal benefit for four years or so. And then, at 70, you get remarried. So that's an incentive to get divorced. And, you know, in my co-author's Paul's case it would have been an extra $50,000. Now, you know, there are obviously other things going on. Costs involved with a divorce, but that's there, really.\r\n\r\nHere's another example of an incentive to get divorced: If you had an ex who was a high earner, and now you're remarried. But you remarried before age 60, and your ex who was a high earner passed away, you can't collect a divorcee widow's benefit. Because you got remarried before age 60. So here you are, maybe age 62. Your ex has just passed away. You want to collect a large widow's benefit. What you can do is get divorced, go in and collect that high widow's benefit. And then, get remarried the next day to the same person. As far as I understand, this is not fraud. This is legal.\r\n\r\nI'm not advocating that we maintain the system. You know, obviously some of this is gaming the system. But the rules make no sense to begin with, and it's not clear what's fair and what's unfair. They're a complicated set of rules. We've been paying 12.4% of our paycheck every year from age 16 on. And we've been buying all these different types of benefits. So why shouldn't we take advantage of what's available?\r\n<!--nextpage-->\nExcept that I don't think the system should be maintained this way. I've got a proposal for how to fix it at ThePurplePlans.org, which would freeze the existing system in place and put a modern Social Security system in place, so that we're not stuck with this forever.\r\n\r\n<strong>Forbes:</strong> Before we get to that, give us the story of the man with the four ex-wives.\r\n<strong>Kotlikoff:</strong> Well, so we set up a hypothetical case in the book, a chapter. It's William T. Gigolo. And he spends his life just basically living off women, and he specializes in marrying them for ten years, and the next day after ten years he divorces them and goes on to the next wife. So that by the time he reaches retirement age, he can start collecting on one spouse after the next.\r\n\r\nAs soon as that spouse reaches age 62, he can start collecting. So if he married a lower-earning spouse first and then a higher-earning spouse second, he can collect on the first spouse to begin with early. And then on the next spouse. And the fact that he took it early doesn't matter. That was the first spouse. She's history. You know, it's like a fresh benefit. So there's no reduction if he's, let's say, full retirement age when the next spouse reaches age 62.\r\n\r\nAnd then, maybe the third spouse passes away. He starts collecting on her. So we have him flipping from one benefit to the next over time, until he's finally, like, age 90 or so in a nursing home. And he meets this older lady who's got a very high earnings history. And he can marry her. And she's about to die. It only takes nine months to be married. Person dies. You can collect a widow's benefit on their record.\r\n\r\n<strong>Forbes:</strong> Well, I can see a <em>Forensic Files</em> crime show on this. And some of the crazy things are, in terms of what they deem as a credit, working history. You point out that it's $1,220. So if you got a fee for something for $5,000, that's deemed a year's work?\r\n<strong>Kotlikoff:</strong> Yeah, you can work less than four quarters and get four quarters of credit, the way it's set up, depending on if you know the rules and how you compress your earnings in a given quarter.\r\n\r\n<strong>Forbes:</strong> And have they dealt with gay marriage yet?\r\n<strong>Kotlikoff:</strong> Gay marriage, you can collect all the benefits of somebody's who's of heterosexual married couples, the same benefits, if you are living in a state that recognizes gay marriage. If you got married, for example, in Massachusetts, recognizes gay marriage, and then you move to Texas, no you don't get the benefits. You can get your own retirement benefit, but you can't collect on your spouse. So that's I think grossly unfair. I think Social Security should not discriminate against gay couples, period.\r\n\r\n<strong>Forbes:</strong> But one of the dangers, as you pointed out earlier in this whole thing is that they could render this whole book null and void by changing all the rules overnight. And nobody can stop them.\r\n<strong>Kotlikoff:</strong> Right. So in advocating that we adopt the Purple Social Security Plan, again, that's at ThePurplePlans.org, for anybody who wants to look, I'm advocating the end of the life of my book. Because I think this co-authored book would have a long life span if they don't change the rules. Or if they just modify the rules so we can write new additions of this book all the time.\r\n\r\nBut I would prefer to see the system fixed. Because not only is it crazy complex, but it's underfinanced to the tune of 33%. This system is in worse long-term financial shape than the Detroit pensions at the time Detroit went bankrupt. They were about 20% underfinanced. The trustees report that was released in July by the Social Security Trustees, if you look at Table 6-F1, you'll see that it's 33% underfinanced. You have to read all the fine print and get it straight. But it's right there.\r\n<!--nextpage-->\nApparently the trustees themselves didn't read this table, because they make no mention of it, okay. These are all, you know, political appointees. And it's not just, you know, the Democratic administration. We're talking about Republican administrations. They've been hiding the truth about Social Security for years, because they've been looking at these truncated projections.\r\n\r\nThey only look out 75 years, which may seem fine. But your grandchildren are going to have paid a lot of taxes and expect benefits beyond that. So there's no economic rationale for looking myopically at the system. You have to look at the whole future and all the taxes and all the outflow that has to be paid by those taxes. And the system's broke. And it's not broke 20 years from now or ten years from now or five years from now. It's broke today.\r\n\r\n<strong>Forbes:</strong> So the accusation that by writing this subversive book you are hastening the demise of the system, you're making the point, \"Nobody knows what the system is anyway. And we've got to truly fix it.\"\r\n<strong>Kotlikoff:</strong> I think we need to fix it. My co-authors differ. We have a chapter at the end of the book where we debate. They think the system's in better financial shape than I do. They're not worried about it. They're not economists. I think economics is pretty clear about budgets. And our kids cannot afford what we're doing to them.\r\n\r\n<strong>Forbes:</strong> Call it fiscal child abuse.\r\n<strong>Kotlikoff:</strong> I think we're actually engaged in a war on our children in a lot of dimensions. And it's not just fiscal, it's how we're dealing with the climate and how we're dealing with education and how we're dealing with foreign wars. So I think we have to think very carefully about what we're doing with our children. Twenty percent are in poverty as we speak.\r\n\r\n<strong>Forbes:</strong> Chris Christie. His fix is a non-fix in your mind?\r\n<strong>Kotlikoff:</strong> So his fix is to eliminate the benefits for people earning more than $200,000 in income.\r\n\r\n<strong>Forbes:</strong> Singly $200,000.\r\n<strong>Kotlikoff:</strong> Right. I think this is, like, coming out of the hip pocket. I don't think that's a comprehensive fix to the system. It's going to give people worse work incentives. People are going to have to pay 12.4% of their pay and realize they're not getting anything back for it. I think it's just an example of piecemeal reform.\r\n\r\nWe need to have collective reform of our tax system, our Social Security system, our health care system, and our banking system. We need to have honest, long-term fiscal accounting that more than 1,200 economists have endorsed. If you go to TheInformAct.org, you'll see an endorsement by over 1,200 economists from every top department, including 17 Nobel Prize winners, who are saying that the government is systematically lying about its fiscal books. That its got most of its liabilities off the books.\r\n\r\n<strong>Forbes:</strong> Just one little factoid. The overall debt allegedly is about, what, $18 trillion. Held by the public is a little over $12 trillion. And you make the point that the real debt is $241 trillion?\r\n<strong>Kotlikoff:</strong> $210 trillion. The fiscal gap that economists, as a profession really, because if you look at this, it's a who's who of economists from both sides of the political aisle. They're saying, \"This is the way we should look at our liabilities. We shouldn't put certain things on the books and keep other things off the books by using fancy accounting, by using special words.\"\r\n<!--nextpage-->\n<strong>Forbes:</strong> You use the example of your mother, the two checks she gets.\r\n<strong>Kotlikoff:</strong> Yeah. My mom is 95. I just spoke with her this morning. She is in great shape, mentally alert. And she just won a grand slam of the bridge game the other day. So she's collecting two checks in the mail. They look the same. One's for Social Security and one's for interest and principal on a Treasury bill. The present value of those interest and principal payments is on the books. The present value of her Social Security checks is not on the books.\r\n\r\nThat was just a matter of a language choice. When they took money from my mom and gave her back the Treasury bill they said they were borrowing from her. And then they called the payments in the future \"return of principal plus interest.\" When they took money from my mom for Social Security, they called it \"taxation.\" And the payment in the future they called \"transfer payment.\" So it was called \"taxes and transfer payments,\" rather than \"borrowing and repayment.\" That is a matter of language. It has no economic basis.\r\n\r\nSo the $13 trillion in official debt in the hands of the public is a meaningless number. The true fiscal picture is that we have expenditures that have a present value that's huge. And we subtract the present value of the taxes, and the net difference is called the fiscal gap. That's $210 trillion. That's a description of bankruptcy. The country is 58% underfinanced, in the sense that to come up with $210 trillion in present value, we need to raise every single federal tax immediately and permanently by 58%.\r\n\r\n<strong>Forbes:</strong> Of course, that would wreck the economy.\r\n<strong>Kotlikoff:</strong> That would wreck the economy. So we need to fix things in a way that works. And we can't have Chris Christie coming up with, you know, \"Well, let's do this,\" out of the blue. We need economists. You know, I think that we wouldn't have politicians build their own bridge over the Hudson. We would actually hire engineers. And I think here we need to have economists, not politicians, redesign these systems.\r\n\r\n<strong>Forbes:</strong> You have Democrats saying they're going to raise benefits.\r\n<strong>Kotlikoff:</strong> Right. Senator Sanders is running for President now and wants to increase Social Security benefits. We need to worry about inequality. And we have a lot of poor older people, so I understand where he's coming from. But we need to understand the hole we're in to begin with. And we need to get a handle on that and look systematically at how all the different fiscal programs we've got are interacting.\r\n\r\nSo I'm doing some research on that with an economist at Berkeley named <a href='http://www.forbes.com/profile/alan-auerbach/'>Alan Auerbach</a>. We'll have a study out very shortly. But, you know, if you look at it, there are 25 different major fiscal programs that have their own tax systems and their own redistribution. So let's see what the overall picture is and also what the incentives to work and save are. And then come up with some solutions before we start piecemeal doing this or that.\r\n\r\n<strong>Forbes:</strong> One other topic we just touched briefly on, since it takes investors, is the Securities Investor Protection Corp., SIPC, which we're told means a broker, your account is insured for at least $500,000. You say, ain't so.\r\n<strong>Kotlikoff:</strong> I think this is one of the biggest frauds that <a href='http://www.forbes.com/wall-street/'>Wall Street</a> is committing. They have this institution called SIPC. And you have this sense if you open up a brokerage account that you're insured up to $500,000 if it's stolen. But if you look at the victims of the two largest Ponzi schemes in history, the Stanford Ponzi scheme and the Madoff Ponzi scheme, none of the Stanford victims have been compensated even a penny. And a large fraction of the Madoff victims have received nothing.\r\n\r\nAnd, indeed, they're going after many of the Madoff victims to take money back. And so, what they're doing is, they're saying that if you put money in and you took out more than you put in, then you are a winner and therefore you're not insured under SIPC. And therefore, whatever money you had left, you've lost, and also we're not going to pay you the $500,000.\r\n<!--nextpage-->\nNow, just think about it, Steve. Suppose you put in some money when you were 30. Maybe you put in $200,000 into an account with some broker, with some firm. And it grows, you're told. You know, it's in the stock market and over time it compounds. And you have to take out money every year to pay the taxes. Okay? And then, you know, comes to some point where you take out a big chunk of money maybe to treat your wife for her cancer or to make a charitable contribution, whatever. And then, two years later, fraud is discovered. Well, you're going to be viewed as a net winner, because you took out more money than you put in.\r\n\r\n<strong>Forbes:</strong> But you had nothing to do with the fraud.\r\n<strong>Kotlikoff:</strong> You had nothing to do with the fraud. So you're now viewed as a criminal, and you're treated as such. And let's say you had $3 million in the account. You took out $1 million to give to charity. You've lost $2 million. They're not going to give you the $500,000 to insure against the $2 million loss. They're going to actually sue you for the difference between the $1 million and the $200,000 you put in originally, which is $800,000.\r\n\r\nThis is incredibly risky. No one should keep their brokerage account at this point. It's too dangerous. I wrote a column for Forbes called, <em>Close Your Brokerage Account</em>. It got enormous analysis by people. A lot of people looked at it, and then the head of SIPC wrote a response, which I responded to in turn. And I think people can go to Forbes and look at this debate. And I think they'll come away agreeing with me. It's straightforward. This is just fraud. They're advertising insurance, and they're not providing it.\r\n\r\n<strong>Forbes:</strong> The legislative remedy is a bill called the Restoring Main Street Investor Protection and Confidence Act, the Garrett-Maloney bill. So you think Congress will finally pass that? Bipartisan. Garrett's a Republican. Maloney's a Democrat.\r\n<strong>Kotlikoff:</strong> Yeah. I think until that bill is passed, and it needs to be passed immediately, everybody who's got a brokerage account should close it down. Because it's not safe. If you take your money out and spend it, you can't sleep at night for two years. Because there's a call back. So you can be sued, depending on your situation, and for that money that you withdrew. You're own broker might not be involved. It might be some other broker down the hall that was engaged in the fraud in that particular account. So you're getting hit by double fraud. Not only are you defrauded by the broker, but also by SIPC.\r\n\r\n<strong>Forbes:</strong> So two disturbing things. One, Social Security, which as bad as the tax code. And the other is SIPC, which ain't what it's supposed to be.\r\n<strong>Kotlikoff:</strong> Yes. And both need to be fixed and fixed immediately.\r\n\r\n<strong>Forbes:</strong> Well, thank you. Let's hope something gets done, positive.\r\n<strong>Kotlikoff:</strong> My pleasure.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;","description":"Boston University economist Laurence Kotlikoff helps demystify Social Security benefits.","type":"blog","storyType":"post","uri":"http://www.forbes.com/sites/steveforbes/2015/06/08/why-millions-of-social-security-recipients-arent-getting-what-theyre-entitled-to-expert-laurence-kotlikoff-explains/","comments":[],"visible":true,"promotedChannelSections":[{"channel":"channel_2","section":"","title":"Why Millions Of Social Security Recipients Aren't Getting What They're Entitled To","description":"Boston University economist Laurence Kotlikoff helps demystify Social Security benefits.","image":"/images/channels/channel_2_panel2_1_threeacross-1433853095.jpg","location":"top"}],"blogId":"907","authors":[{"naturalId":"blogAuthorId/blog/author/576","name":"Steve Forbes","avatars":[{"size":136,"image":"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/2a285856910828b7dcef07cfaeefe22d?s=136&amp;d=http%3A%2F%2F0.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2Fad516503a11cd5ca435acc9bb6523536%3Fs%3D136&amp;r=G"},{"size":40,"image":"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/2a285856910828b7dcef07cfaeefe22d?s=40&amp;d=http%3A%2F%2F0.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2Fad516503a11cd5ca435acc9bb6523536%3Fs%3D40&amp;r=G"},{"size":400,"image":"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/2a285856910828b7dcef07cfaeefe22d?s=400&amp;d=http%3A%2F%2F0.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2Fad516503a11cd5ca435acc9bb6523536%3Fs%3D400&amp;r=G"},{"size":62,"image":"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/2a285856910828b7dcef07cfaeefe22d?s=62&amp;d=http%3A%2F%2F0.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2Fad516503a11cd5ca435acc9bb6523536%3Fs%3D62&amp;r=G"}],"url":"http://www.forbes.com/sites/steveforbes/","type":"Forbes Staff","profileUrl":"/sites/steveforbes/","twitterName":"steveforbesceo","authorType":"individual","facebookName":"forbesadmin","email":"sforbes@forbes.com","blog":false,"numFollowers":0,"shortBio":"“With all thy getting, get understanding.\"","amazon":"http://www.amazon.com/Freedom-Manifesto-Markets-Moral-Government/dp/030795157X","timestamp":1445787613391,"description":"Steve Forbes is Chairman and Editor-in-Chief of Forbes Media.\r\n\r\nSteve’s new book: Money: How the Destruction of the Dollar Threatens the Global Economy - and What We Can Do About It, co-authored by Elizabeth Ames (McGraw-Hill Professional) comes out  next month.\r\n\r\nSteve writes editorials for each issue of Forbes under the heading of “Fact and Comment.”  A widely respected economic prognosticator, he is the only writer to have won the highly prestigious Crystal Owl Award four times.

We’re going to discuss your book, <em>Get What’s Yours,</em> which is now a bestseller. You know, once upon a time concerning Social Security, we all thought if you took it at 62 you’d get less than you would at 66 or 70. So the longer you waited, the more you got, and that’s that. And your wife would get something. If you’re disabled, you might get something. But pretty simple. We all know the federal income tax code is a horror. I can tell you the federal election laws are a horror. But whoever would have thought something seemingly as simple as Social Security would be so gosh darn complex. Hence, the need for this book.</p>\n<p><strong>Larry Kotlikoff:</strong> Well, Steve, thanks for having me. And the system is incredibly complicated. There are 2,728 rules in their handbook. And there’s literally hundreds of thousands of rules about those 2,728 rules in what’s called their program operating manual system. And all these rules and rules about the rules are written in geek. That’s not Greek, it’s geek, a language that nobody can understand.</p>\n<div id=\"inread\" article-ad-inbody=\"inread\" class=\"inread\"></div>\n<p>So people are flying blind when it comes to collecting Social Security. There’s more than one benefit to be collected. There’s not just your retirement benefit. There are actually 12 different benefits that you can collect. Parent benefits. Child benefits. Spouse benefits, as you mentioned. Widow benefits. Divorcee benefits for spouses and for widows. And it goes on.</p>\n<p><strong>Forbes:</strong> So, you say that just as one little example, Americans leave $10 billion in unclaimed spousal benefits on the table each year. $10 billion?</p>\n<p><strong>Kotlikoff:</strong> Yeah, that’s a lot of money.</p>\n<div class=\"vestpocket\" vest-pocket=\"\"></div>\n<p><strong>Forbes:</strong> It’s just the beginning.</p>\n<p><strong>Kotlikoff:</strong> It’s the beginning. And people that don’t know what they’re doing could inadvertently lose their spousal benefit, because Social Security has this gotcha that if you try and take two benefits at once, you’ll get the larger of the two. So one will wipe out the other. So the key to collecting a spousal benefit is to collect it by itself and let your retirement benefit grow. This is actually how the book got initiated.</p>\n<p>My tennis partner, Paul Solman, who’s the <em>PBS News Hour</em> economics correspondent… we were taking a break from tennis because he was beating me. I needed a rest. I started asking him when he’s going to take Social Security. And he says, “Don’t bother me. I’ve got it all figured out.” I kept pushing him on this, and within a couple minutes I had made him $50,000 and forced him to buy me dinner, just in free spousal benefits.</p>","<p>And the trick in his case was, his wife had to permit him to get a spousal benefit by filing for her own retirement benefit, suspending its collection so she could wait until 70 to get her retirement benefit. And then he went and collected just his spousal benefit and waited until 70 to collect his retirement benefit.</p>\n<p><strong>Forbes:</strong> Already getting complicated. So it’s fair to say we have a system today that randomly redistributes between those who know the rules and those who don’t?</p>\n<p><strong>Kotlikoff:</strong> Yeah. We’re very concerned in this country about inequality. And this is really outrageous. The fact that our basic saving system is so user unfriendly that some people who pay the same taxes potentially get very different outcomes because they don’t understand the rules. So that’s really one of the big motivations for writing the book.</p>\n<p><strong>Forbes:</strong> So how did it become so complex? Something seemingly basic. We all think of Franklin Roosevelt and Ida Fuller. You just put the money in and collect it. How did it become so IRS-like?</p>\n<p><strong>Kotlikoff:</strong> Well, we tend in our country not to start from scratch to fix things or redesign things. We just start to add on things. So over the years they added spousal benefits and survivor benefits and disability benefits. And the bureaucrats just had a field day. They just went crazy and decided that they were the social gods.</p>\n<div id=\"inread\" article-ad-inbody=\"inread\" class=\"inread\"></div>\n<p>They would decide who would get what, if they did it exactly this way. And if they didn’t get it exactly right, they would not get whatever it was that could be gotten. So this is really a bureaucrat’s paradise, this system. And it’s a national disgrace. I’m not opposed to Social Security; I want to point out. I think that we should be forcing people to save and forcing them to have disability and life insurance and longevity insurance. But the way this is structured is just really unbelievable.</p>\n<p><strong>Forbes:</strong> Does Congress have any real idea of what the system really is?</p>\n<p><strong>Kotlikoff:</strong> Well, I’ve been encouraging people to buy a copy of the book for their members of Congress and also call up their congressman and ask them what they should do, in terms of their benefit collection, just to drive the members of Congress crazy to the point where they actually realize what it is that they created. They created a monster here over the years. And they need to fix it. We can’t sentence every generation to come along to deal with a system that’s this complicated and awful.</p>\n<div class=\"vestpocket\" vest-pocket=\"\"></div>\n<p><strong>Forbes:</strong> You make the point going to the Social Security Administration—good people though they may be—that’s the last point you want to go to get sound advice.</p>\n<p><strong>Kotlikoff:</strong> Yeah. I would say about 40% of the time the people at Social Security are giving you the wrong answer. Either 100% wrong or partially wrong, or they’re not really thinking through carefully your situation. I’ll give you an example. I’ve got a gentleman I met at a dinner party recently. He’s a doctor in Boston. He’s 68. He was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. So he hadn’t taken Social Security.</p>\n<p>And he told me that he went to Social Security. And they said, “Well you need to take the benefit right away, because gee, you’re about to die, and you’ll at least get something.” And that’s what he did. And they even gave him benefits retroactively for six months. He thought that was the right thing to do. Now, I started asking him about his wife. Turns out, his wife is 65. And she didn’t have much of an earnings history. So what they told him to do was the wrong thing, because they didn’t ask him about his wife or her earnings history.</p>\n<p>And the best thing for him to do was wait until 70 and see if he made it that long, because if he makes it until 70, her widow’s benefit will be 16% higher for the entire rest of her life. She could make it to 100. Every month, she’ll have a 16% higher check to open because he did the right thing, which was different from what they advised. So he’s actually able to undo what they did, because he has a year to withdraw his decision and then start from scratch. And that’s what he’s doing.</p>","<p><strong>Forbes:</strong> Just one example…each week, for PBS and for Forbes, you take a question like the old Dear Abby and give an answer. This one individual asks, “I’ll be 66 October 3rd. Quit my full-time job December 31.” And then, I’m not going to read the whole question, but just the answer tells you all you need to know. This is what you say: “In my answer, I’m going to assume you can’t collect spousal, widow’s, divorcee spousal or divorcee widow’s benefits. In other words, I’m going to assume you were never married or were married for less than ten years before getting divorced. Under these assumptions, your best course is to wait until then you go and give the answer. That scrambles the brain.</p>\n<p><strong>Kotlikoff:</strong> Yeah. You know, the curious thing is it’s really a Sudoku puzzle, this system. And a lot of people are reading this column, even after they figure out what to do for themselves because they find it interesting to solve the puzzle. They want to learn the rules so that they can figure out for the next person whether they read about it, can they guess the answer before I give the answer? And that’s the funny thing. But it’s not really a joke or a puzzle. It’s really sad that every answer with Social Security begins and ends with a “but.” You know, “Do this, but. If you’re in this situation, it’s different.”</p>\n<p><strong>Forbes:</strong> So you point out that we all think the risk for Social Security is your friend with the pancreatic cancer, “I better take it now, because I might not be around to get it. And I’ve spent a whole lifetime putting money in. Nothing’s going to be there.” You make the point, though, that for all the travails of old age, the real risk is the risk of living.</p>\n<p><strong>Kotlikoff:</strong> Yeah. Because, you know, we’re all fixated on death and illness surrounding death. And that’s our focus. And Social Security for years was telling people they should take their money right away so that they can get something before they die. And we’re all sure that we’re going to die on time. But, as you just indicated, there’s just no guarantee you’re going to die on time. The real risk from life is not dying, because you get to go to Heaven if you die. The real risk is living to 100 and not having the means to sustain yourself.</p>\n<div id=\"inread\" article-ad-inbody=\"inread\" class=\"inread\"></div>\n<p>So if you’re this very simple case of somebody who’s 62 and you have the option of waiting until 70, they can take a 76% higher benefit adjusted for inflation if they wait till 70. And that will continue right up to 100 or whatever, 110 if they live that long. And that’s really insurance, longevity insurance. It’s dealing with the worst-case scenario, which in this case is living. It’s not dying.</p>\n<p><strong>Forbes:</strong> It’s the ultimate annuity.</p>\n<p><strong>Kotlikoff:</strong> Yeah, it’s an annuity. It’s exactly that longevity insurance. And that has tremendous value to people if they understand what’s involved here. So we push that point very strongly in the book, in the second chapter, actually.</p>\n<div class=\"vestpocket\" vest-pocket=\"\"></div>\n<p><strong>Forbes:</strong> So you have three general rules.</p>\n<p><strong>Kotlikoff:</strong> The three general rules are: be patient because there is this huge pay-off built into the system from waiting. It’s not true for everybody, but everybody should be patient, because in some cases you want to take your benefit early in order to enable benefits for your kids or spouse or both. But in general, patience is going to pay off. Then, you want to be aware of all the benefits.</p>\n<p><strong>Forbes:</strong> That’s like marriage. Be patient.</p>\n<p><strong>Kotlikoff:</strong> Right. Exactly. And then, you want to be aware of all the benefits. And then, the third thing is you need to strategize. You need to time your benefit collection so that one doesn’t wipe out the other. Because again, you can’t get two at once, two benefits at once. They’ll give you just the larger of the two. So the general idea is to take one benefit early and let the other one grow and then take that.</p>\n<p><strong>Forbes:</strong> So for people to begin to understand this thing, this new world… file and suspend, maybe unsuspend. Walk us through that.</p>\n<p><strong>Kotlikoff:</strong> Okay. We call this start, stop, start. Start your benefit, stop it, and start it up again. So I’ll give you an example of a real case. A 62-year-old gentleman who’s married to a 45-year-old wife whose child is disabled and was disabled before age 22.</p>\n<p>So if he starts his benefit early, he can therefore get a child benefit going for his child and also what’s called a “child in care” spouse benefit for his wife. She was working, but now she’s stopped working. She’s going to watch over the child. And he has the option at full retirement at age 66 in his case to suspend his benefit and start it up again at 70. And it’s not just special for him. Anybody who’s started their benefit early can suspend it once they reach full retirement age or any time after full retirement age, up to 70. And then start it up at 70 again at a higher level. It’s 8% per year for every year that you suspend.</p>","<p><strong>Forbes:</strong> So at 62, you can…</p>\n<p><strong>Kotlikoff:</strong> Suspend it at 66, and then at 70, you start it at 32% higher.</p>\n<p><strong>Forbes:</strong> So if you start at 62, you take benefits. And then suspend the benefit.</p>\n<p><strong>Kotlikoff:</strong> You suspend the benefit. You go into Social Security, and you say, “I’d like to suspend my benefit.” And if you talk to the right person, they will understand that’s an option. And, if not, you go talk to a different person. After you read the book, you see this is actually what you can do. And then at 70, you start it up again at a 32% higher number. So every year from 70 to maybe 100, you’re opening a 32% higher check.</p>\n<p>Anyway, you’ve sacrificed your own benefits— this gentleman has—because they’re going to start this lower level retirement benefit because he took his benefit early at a 32% higher level. That’s going to be a benefit starting from 70 that’s lower than had he never taken anything and waited just until 70. But he’s taken a hit on his benefits, but he’s produced higher benefits for his wife and his child.</p>\n<div id=\"inread\" article-ad-inbody=\"inread\" class=\"inread\"></div>\n<p>And, in that case, it turns out that there are about ten different benefits this household has to collect through time. Because the child first collects on the dad. Then when the mom takes her retirement benefits, since she had a higher earnings history, he collects on her. Then the dad dies. He collects a child survivor benefit on the dad, because that’s larger than the child benefit. And then he collects on the mom. It goes like that. That’s the case.</p>\n<p><strong>Forbes:</strong> So when these rules are changed, do they have public hearings? Or how are these things conjured up?</p>\n<p><strong>Kotlikoff:</strong> Well, I’ll tell you kind of a sad story here. We wrote in the book that disabled people could get free spousal benefits by withdrawing their immediate conversion of their disability benefit at full retirement age into a retirement benefit; that they could withdraw that conversion and then just file for a spousal benefit by itself. And then take their retirement benefit at its highest value at 70. So that they would have the same potential as married people or divorced people to get a full spousal benefit.</p>\n<div class=\"vestpocket\" vest-pocket=\"\"></div>\n<p>And that’s in the book. And then on December 23, right before Christmas, some bureaucrat in Social Security changed the provision in this huge program operating manual system rules that denied the disabled this right. So they deprived millions of disabled people in the course of a couple sentences from the ability to do what the law clearly allowed them to do. It’s outrageous, but these people are legislating benefits on their own. These bureaucrats think it’s in their power. And I wrote about it. And it really is outrageous that they did this. It’s discriminatory.</p>\n<p><strong>Forbes:</strong> Was that the do-over?</p>\n<p><strong>Kotlikoff:</strong> That was not the do-over.</p>\n<p><strong>Forbes:</strong> What was the do-over?</p>\n<p><strong>Kotlikoff:</strong> The do-over was that, thanks to Janet Novack from Forbes, I learned about the ability to withdraw your retirement benefit really at any time. Pay back what you had received, without any interest, and start from scratch. And I wrote about it. Janet wrote about it. Others wrote about it.</p>","<p>And, at some point, Social Security changed the law and said that you can’t do this beyond one year. You can withdraw your filling for your retirement benefit, but you only have a year to do it. It used to be unlimited. So that changed as well, just by somebody at Social Security by decree. I think that had more sense. That wasn’t really so much discriminating against people. But this thing with disability, I think is really lousy.</p>\n<p><strong>Forbes:</strong> Deeming rules. What are deeming rules?</p>\n<p><strong>Kotlikoff:</strong> So one of the things we have in the book is a list of 25 ‘gotchas,’—the worst gotchas in Social Security. Deeming is maybe the worst. Here’s the deal: Steve, you and I are both married. We’re both 60. Maybe you’re 66. You filed for your retirement benefit. And maybe you’re 70 when you filed for your retirement benefit.</p>\n<p>And so now, I’m in a position to file for my spousal benefit. So because you’re my spouse and all you have to do is have filed for your retirement benefit. So if I file before full retirement age for my spousal benefit thinking I can wait to collect my own retirement benefit at 70, no. Because what happens is, if I do it before full retirement age, I’m going to be deemed to also be filing for my retirement benefit.</p>\n<p>And then they’re going to give me the larger of the two. And that would most likely be my retirement benefit, which means my spousal benefit which I filed for, which I wanted to get is going to be wiped out forever. And then I’m going to be left with a permanently reduced retirement benefit. So it’s really a double whammy. That’s deeming.</p>\n<div id=\"inread\" article-ad-inbody=\"inread\" class=\"inread\"></div>\n<p>If you try and take your spousal benefit early, you’re forced to take your retirement benefit early. If you take your retirement benefit early, you’re forced to take your spousal benefit early. That’s one of the things we warn people to be careful about.</p>\n<p><strong>Forbes:</strong> Amazing. So things that this now crazy system encourages: Divorce.</p>\n<p><strong>Kotlikoff:</strong> Divorce, yeah. It turns out that only one of two spouses in a marriage can get a full spousal benefit. Again, if they play their cards right in terms of the timing and everything. But if you get divorced, both spouses can get a full spousal benefit. So if you got divorced two years before you reach full retirement age, you could then live in sin and you both could collect a full spousal benefit for four years or so. And then, at 70, you get remarried. So that’s an incentive to get divorced. And, you know, in my co-author’s Paul’s case it would have been an extra $50,000. Now, you know, there are obviously other things going on. Costs involved with a divorce, but that’s there, really.</p>\n<div class=\"vestpocket\" vest-pocket=\"\"></div>\n<p>Here’s another example of an incentive to get divorced: If you had an ex who was a high earner, and now you’re remarried. But you remarried before age 60, and your ex who was a high earner passed away, you can’t collect a divorcee widow’s benefit. Because you got remarried before age 60. So here you are, maybe age 62. Your ex has just passed away. You want to collect a large widow’s benefit. What you can do is get divorced, go in and collect that high widow’s benefit. And then, get remarried the next day to the same person. As far as I understand, this is not fraud. This is legal.</p>\n<p>I’m not advocating that we maintain the system. You know, obviously some of this is gaming the system. But the rules make no sense to begin with, and it’s not clear what’s fair and what’s unfair. They’re a complicated set of rules. We’ve been paying 12.4% of our paycheck every year from age 16 on. And we’ve been buying all these different types of benefits. So why shouldn’t we take advantage of what’s available?</p>","<p>Except that I don’t think the system should be maintained this way. I’ve got a proposal for how to fix it at ThePurplePlans.org, which would freeze the existing system in place and put a modern Social Security system in place, so that we’re not stuck with this forever.</p>\n<p><strong>Forbes:</strong> Before we get to that, give us the story of the man with the four ex-wives.</p>\n<p><strong>Kotlikoff:</strong> Well, so we set up a hypothetical case in the book, a chapter. It’s William T. Gigolo. And he spends his life just basically living off women, and he specializes in marrying them for ten years, and the next day after ten years he divorces them and goes on to the next wife. So that by the time he reaches retirement age, he can start collecting on one spouse after the next.</p>\n<p>As soon as that spouse reaches age 62, he can start collecting. So if he married a lower-earning spouse first and then a higher-earning spouse second, he can collect on the first spouse to begin with early. And then on the next spouse. And the fact that he took it early doesn’t matter. That was the first spouse. She’s history. You know, it’s like a fresh benefit. So there’s no reduction if he’s, let’s say, full retirement age when the next spouse reaches age 62.</p>\n<p>And then, maybe the third spouse passes away. He starts collecting on her. So we have him flipping from one benefit to the next over time, until he’s finally, like, age 90 or so in a nursing home. And he meets this older lady who’s got a very high earnings history. And he can marry her. And she’s about to die. It only takes nine months to be married. Person dies. You can collect a widow’s benefit on their record.</p>\n<div id=\"inread\" article-ad-inbody=\"inread\" class=\"inread\"></div>\n<p><strong>Forbes:</strong> Well, I can see a <em>Forensic Files</em> crime show on this. And some of the crazy things are, in terms of what they deem as a credit, working history. You point out that it’s $1,220. So if you got a fee for something for $5,000, that’s deemed a year’s work?</p>\n<p><strong>Kotlikoff:</strong> Yeah, you can work less than four quarters and get four quarters of credit, the way it’s set up, depending on if you know the rules and how you compress your earnings in a given quarter.</p>\n<div class=\"vestpocket\" vest-pocket=\"\"></div>\n<p><strong>Forbes:</strong> And have they dealt with gay marriage yet?</p>\n<p><strong>Kotlikoff:</strong> Gay marriage, you can collect all the benefits of somebody’s who’s of heterosexual married couples, the same benefits, if you are living in a state that recognizes gay marriage. If you got married, for example, in Massachusetts, recognizes gay marriage, and then you move to Texas, no you don’t get the benefits. You can get your own retirement benefit, but you can’t collect on your spouse. So that’s I think grossly unfair. I think Social Security should not discriminate against gay couples, period.</p>\n<p><strong>Forbes:</strong> But one of the dangers, as you pointed out earlier in this whole thing is that they could render this whole book null and void by changing all the rules overnight. And nobody can stop them.</p>\n<p><strong>Kotlikoff:</strong> Right. So in advocating that we adopt the Purple Social Security Plan, again, that’s at ThePurplePlans.org, for anybody who wants to look, I’m advocating the end of the life of my book. Because I think this co-authored book would have a long life span if they don’t change the rules. Or if they just modify the rules so we can write new additions of this book all the time.</p>\n<p>But I would prefer to see the system fixed. Because not only is it crazy complex, but it’s underfinanced to the tune of 33%. This system is in worse long-term financial shape than the Detroit pensions at the time Detroit went bankrupt. They were about 20% underfinanced. The trustees report that was released in July by the Social Security Trustees, if you look at Table 6-F1, you’ll see that it’s 33% underfinanced. You have to read all the fine print and get it straight. But it’s right there.</p>","<p>Apparently the trustees themselves didn’t read this table, because they make no mention of it, okay. These are all, you know, political appointees. And it’s not just, you know, the Democratic administration. We’re talking about Republican administrations. They’ve been hiding the truth about Social Security for years, because they’ve been looking at these truncated projections.</p>\n<p>They only look out 75 years, which may seem fine. But your grandchildren are going to have paid a lot of taxes and expect benefits beyond that. So there’s no economic rationale for looking myopically at the system. You have to look at the whole future and all the taxes and all the outflow that has to be paid by those taxes. And the system’s broke. And it’s not broke 20 years from now or ten years from now or five years from now. It’s broke today.</p>\n<p><strong>Forbes:</strong> So the accusation that by writing this subversive book you are hastening the demise of the system, you’re making the point, “Nobody knows what the system is anyway. And we’ve got to truly fix it.”</p>\n<p><strong>Kotlikoff:</strong> I think we need to fix it. My co-authors differ. We have a chapter at the end of the book where we debate. They think the system’s in better financial shape than I do. They’re not worried about it. They’re not economists. I think economics is pretty clear about budgets. And our kids cannot afford what we’re doing to them.</p>\n<div id=\"inread\" article-ad-inbody=\"inread\" class=\"inread\"></div>\n<p><strong>Forbes:</strong> Call it fiscal child abuse.</p>\n<p><strong>Kotlikoff:</strong> I think we’re actually engaged in a war on our children in a lot of dimensions. And it’s not just fiscal, it’s how we’re dealing with the climate and how we’re dealing with education and how we’re dealing with foreign wars. So I think we have to think very carefully about what we’re doing with our children. Twenty percent are in poverty as we speak.</p>\n<p><strong>Forbes:</strong> Chris Christie. His fix is a non-fix in your mind?</p>\n<p><strong>Kotlikoff:</strong> So his fix is to eliminate the benefits for people earning more than $200,000 in income.</p>\n<div class=\"vestpocket\" vest-pocket=\"\"></div>\n<p><strong>Forbes:</strong> Singly $200,000.</p>\n<p><strong>Kotlikoff:</strong> Right. I think this is, like, coming out of the hip pocket. I don’t think that’s a comprehensive fix to the system. It’s going to give people worse work incentives. People are going to have to pay 12.4% of their pay and realize they’re not getting anything back for it. I think it’s just an example of piecemeal reform.</p>\n<p>We need to have collective reform of our tax system, our Social Security system, our health care system, and our banking system. We need to have honest, long-term fiscal accounting that more than 1,200 economists have endorsed. If you go to TheInformAct.org, you’ll see an endorsement by over 1,200 economists from every top department, including 17 Nobel Prize winners, who are saying that the government is systematically lying about its fiscal books. That its got most of its liabilities off the books.</p>\n<p><strong>Forbes:</strong> Just one little factoid. The overall debt allegedly is about, what, $18 trillion. Held by the public is a little over $12 trillion. And you make the point that the real debt is $241 trillion?</p>\n<p><strong>Kotlikoff:</strong> $210 trillion. The fiscal gap that economists, as a profession really, because if you look at this, it’s a who’s who of economists from both sides of the political aisle. They’re saying, “This is the way we should look at our liabilities. We shouldn’t put certain things on the books and keep other things off the books by using fancy accounting, by using special words.”</p>","<p><strong>Forbes:</strong> You use the example of your mother, the two checks she gets.</p>\n<p><strong>Kotlikoff:</strong> Yeah. My mom is 95. I just spoke with her this morning. She is in great shape, mentally alert. And she just won a grand slam of the bridge game the other day. So she’s collecting two checks in the mail. They look the same. One’s for Social Security and one’s for interest and principal on a Treasury bill. The present value of those interest and principal payments is on the books. The present value of her Social Security checks is not on the books.</p>\n<p>That was just a matter of a language choice. When they took money from my mom and gave her back the Treasury bill they said they were borrowing from her. And then they called the payments in the future “return of principal plus interest.” When they took money from my mom for Social Security, they called it “taxation.” And the payment in the future they called “transfer payment.” So it was called “taxes and transfer payments,” rather than “borrowing and repayment.” That is a matter of language. It has no economic basis.</p>\n<p>So the $13 trillion in official debt in the hands of the public is a meaningless number. The true fiscal picture is that we have expenditures that have a present value that’s huge. And we subtract the present value of the taxes, and the net difference is called the fiscal gap. That’s $210 trillion. That’s a description of bankruptcy. The country is 58% underfinanced, in the sense that to come up with $210 trillion in present value, we need to raise every single federal tax immediately and permanently by 58%.</p>\n<div id=\"inread\" article-ad-inbody=\"inread\" class=\"inread\"></div>\n<p><strong>Forbes:</strong> Of course, that would wreck the economy.</p>\n<p><strong>Kotlikoff:</strong> That would wreck the economy. So we need to fix things in a way that works. And we can’t have Chris Christie coming up with, you know, “Well, let’s do this,” out of the blue. We need economists. You know, I think that we wouldn’t have politicians build their own bridge over the Hudson. We would actually hire engineers. And I think here we need to have economists, not politicians, redesign these systems.</p>\n<p><strong>Forbes:</strong> You have Democrats saying they’re going to raise benefits.</p>\n<p><strong>Kotlikoff:</strong> Right. Senator Sanders is running for President now and wants to increase Social Security benefits. We need to worry about inequality. And we have a lot of poor older people, so I understand where he’s coming from. But we need to understand the hole we’re in to begin with. And we need to get a handle on that and look systematically at how all the different fiscal programs we’ve got are interacting.</p>\n<div class=\"vestpocket\" vest-pocket=\"\"></div>\n<p>So I’m doing some research on that with an economist at Berkeley named <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/profile/alan-auerbach/\" target=\"_self\">Alan Auerbach</a>. We’ll have a study out very shortly. But, you know, if you look at it, there are 25 different major fiscal programs that have their own tax systems and their own redistribution. So let’s see what the overall picture is and also what the incentives to work and save are. And then come up with some solutions before we start piecemeal doing this or that.</p>\n<p><strong>Forbes:</strong> One other topic we just touched briefly on, since it takes investors, is the Securities Investor Protection Corp., SIPC, which we’re told means a broker, your account is insured for at least $500,000. You say, ain’t so.</p>\n<p><strong>Kotlikoff:</strong> I think this is one of the biggest frauds that <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/wall-street/\" target=\"_self\">Wall Street</a> is committing. They have this institution called SIPC. And you have this sense if you open up a brokerage account that you’re insured up to $500,000 if it’s stolen. But if you look at the victims of the two largest Ponzi schemes in history, the Stanford Ponzi scheme and the Madoff Ponzi scheme, none of the Stanford victims have been compensated even a penny. And a large fraction of the Madoff victims have received nothing.</p>\n<p>And, indeed, they’re going after many of the Madoff victims to take money back. And so, what they’re doing is, they’re saying that if you put money in and you took out more than you put in, then you are a winner and therefore you’re not insured under SIPC. And therefore, whatever money you had left, you’ve lost, and also we’re not going to pay you the $500,000.</p>","<p>Now, just think about it, Steve. Suppose you put in some money when you were 30. Maybe you put in $200,000 into an account with some broker, with some firm. And it grows, you’re told. You know, it’s in the stock market and over time it compounds. And you have to take out money every year to pay the taxes. Okay? And then, you know, comes to some point where you take out a big chunk of money maybe to treat your wife for her cancer or to make a charitable contribution, whatever. And then, two years later, fraud is discovered. Well, you’re going to be viewed as a net winner, because you took out more money than you put in.</p>\n<p><strong>Forbes:</strong> But you had nothing to do with the fraud.</p>\n<p><strong>Kotlikoff:</strong> You had nothing to do with the fraud. So you’re now viewed as a criminal, and you’re treated as such. And let’s say you had $3 million in the account. You took out $1 million to give to charity. You’ve lost $2 million. They’re not going to give you the $500,000 to insure against the $2 million loss. They’re going to actually sue you for the difference between the $1 million and the $200,000 you put in originally, which is $800,000.</p>\n<p>This is incredibly risky. No one should keep their brokerage account at this point. It’s too dangerous. I wrote a column for Forbes called, <em>Close Your Brokerage Account</em>. It got enormous analysis by people. A lot of people looked at it, and then the head of SIPC wrote a response, which I responded to in turn. And I think people can go to Forbes and look at this debate. And I think they’ll come away agreeing with me. It’s straightforward. This is just fraud. They’re advertising insurance, and they’re not providing it.</p>\n<p><strong>Forbes:</strong> The legislative remedy is a bill called the Restoring Main Street Investor Protection and Confidence Act, the Garrett-Maloney bill. So you think Congress will finally pass that? Bipartisan. Garrett’s a Republican. Maloney’s a Democrat.</p>\n<div id=\"inread\" article-ad-inbody=\"inread\" class=\"inread\"></div>\n<p><strong>Kotlikoff:</strong> Yeah. I think until that bill is passed, and it needs to be passed immediately, everybody who’s got a brokerage account should close it down. Because it’s not safe. If you take your money out and spend it, you can’t sleep at night for two years. Because there’s a call back. So you can be sued, depending on your situation, and for that money that you withdrew. You’re own broker might not be involved. It might be some other broker down the hall that was engaged in the fraud in that particular account. So you’re getting hit by double fraud. Not only are you defrauded by the broker, but also by SIPC.</p>\n<p><strong>Forbes:</strong> So two disturbing things. One, Social Security, which as bad as the tax code. And the other is SIPC, which ain’t what it’s supposed to be.</p>\n<p><strong>Kotlikoff:</strong> Yes. And both need to be fixed and fixed immediately.</p>\n<div class=\"vestpocket\" vest-pocket=\"\"></div>\n<p><strong>Forbes:</strong> Well, thank you. Let’s hope something gets done, positive.</p>\n<p><strong>Kotlikoff:</strong> My pleasure.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>"],"disableDigest":false,"writtenByForbesStaff":true,"channelSectionMappings":[{"id":"channel_2","channelName":"Investing","url":"/investing"},{"id":"channel_2section_10","channelName":"Investing","sectionName":"Intelligent Investing","url":"/intelligent-investing"},{"id":"channel_2section_14","channelName":"Investing","sectionName":"Retirement","url":"/retirement"},{"id":"channel_2section_65","channelName":"Investing","sectionName":"Personal Finance","url":"/finance"}],"brandVoiceTitle":"Why Millions Of Social Security Recipients Aren't Getting What They're Entitled To--Expert Laurence Kotlikoff Explains","digestDisabled":false,"groupAuthor":{"naturalId":"blogAuthorId/blog/author/blog-907","name":"Fact and Comment","avatars":[{"size":0},{"size":0},{"size":0},{"size":0}],"url":"http://www.forbes.com/sites/steveforbes/","profileUrl":"http://blogs.forbes.com/steveforbes/profile/","twitterName":"steveforbesceo","authorType":"individual","facebookName":"SteveForbesCEO","blog":true,"numFollowers":0,"timestamp":1445787643381,"recentFlag":false,"primaryBlogNaturalId":"blogAuthorId/blog/author/blog-907","primaryContributor":"blogAuthorId/blog/author/576","primaryContributorData":{"naturalId":"blogAuthorId/blog/author/576","name":"Steve Forbes","avatars":[{"size":40,"image":"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/2a285856910828b7dcef07cfaeefe22d?s=40&amp;d=http%3A%2F%2F0.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2Fad516503a11cd5ca435acc9bb6523536%3Fs%3D40&amp;r=G"},{"size":62,"image":"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/2a285856910828b7dcef07cfaeefe22d?s=62&amp;d=http%3A%2F%2F0.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2Fad516503a11cd5ca435acc9bb6523536%3Fs%3D62&amp;r=G"},{"size":136,"image":"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/2a285856910828b7dcef07cfaeefe22d?s=136&amp;d=http%3A%2F%2F0.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2Fad516503a11cd5ca435acc9bb6523536%3Fs%3D136&amp;r=G"},{"size":400,"image":"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/2a285856910828b7dcef07cfaeefe22d?s=400&amp;d=http%3A%2F%2F0.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2Fad516503a11cd5ca435acc9bb6523536%3Fs%3D400&amp;r=G"}],"blog":false,"numFollowers":0,"shortBio":"“With all thy getting, get understanding.\"","description":"Steve Forbes is Chairman and Editor-in-Chief of Forbes Media.<br /><br />\r\n\r\nSteve’s new book: <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Money-Destruction-Dollar-Threatens-Economy/dp/0071823700\">Money: How the Destruction of the Dollar Threatens the Global Economy - and What We Can Do About It</a>, co-authored by Elizabeth Ames (McGraw-Hill Professional) comes out  next month.<br /><br />\r\n\r\nSteve writes editorials for each issue of Forbes under the heading of “Fact and Comment.”  A widely respected economic prognosticator, he is the only writer to have won the highly prestigious Crystal Owl Award four times.
