Eating Up College Campuses","date":1434052140000,"timestamp":1434076075946,"body":"<p>There are CVS stores with the addresses 20 University Place, 116 University Drive and 12290 College Boulevard. You may not have noticed, but you probably saw a glowing red CVS sign the last time you were at a college or university.\r\n\r\nData obtained from [entity display=\"Google\" type=\"organization\" subtype=\"company\" active=\"true\" activated=\"true\" deactivated=\"false\" key=\"google\" ticker=\"GOOGL\" exchange=\"NASDAQ\" natural_id=\"fred/company/1821\"]Google[/entity] Maps reveals that out of the 50 highest schools on <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/top-colleges/\">Forbes&rsquo; 2014 America&rsquo;s Top Colleges</a> list, all but six are located within walking distance or a 10-minute drive of a CVS store. The six exceptions include the federal service schools the <a href='http://www.forbes.com/colleges/united-states-military-academy/'>United States Military Academy</a> and the <a href='http://www.forbes.com/colleges/united-states-air-force-academy/'>United States Air Force Academy</a>, as well as the rural liberal arts schools <a href='http://www.forbes.com/colleges/carleton-college/'>Carleton College</a>, <a href='http://www.forbes.com/colleges/middlebury-college/'>Middlebury College</a> and <a href='http://www.forbes.com/colleges/colgate-university/'>Colgate University</a>.\r\n\r\n<iframe src=\"https://www.google.com/maps/d/embed?mid=zs6IreEMw61E.kPfGG_bvdcas\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\"></iframe>\r\nThis trend points toward the fact that [entity display=\"CVS Caremark\" type=\"organization\" subtype=\"company\" active=\"true\" activated=\"true\" deactivated=\"false\" key=\"cvs-caremark\" ticker=\"CVS\" exchange=\"NYSE\" natural_id=\"fred/company/1186\"]CVS Caremark[/entity], the country&rsquo;s largest pharmacy company in overall sales with a net worth of $117.4 billion, has started viewing college students as a significant consumer base.\r\n\r\nMany of the 7,800 CVS stores nationwide are situated near campuses, although the company doesn't keep track of the exact number, says Mike DeAngelis, director of public relations for CVS. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s important that college communities have access to pharmacy and health care services, and we&rsquo;re very pleased to help serve in that role,&rdquo; he says.\r\n\r\nCVS has its corporate headquarters in the town of Woonsocket, RI. In the nearby city of Providence, RI, the eight CVS stores outnumber the seven colleges and universities. Students at <a href='http://www.forbes.com/colleges/brown-university/'>Brown University</a>, the Rhode Island School of Design, <a href='http://www.forbes.com/colleges/roger-williams-university/'>Roger Williams University</a> and the <a href='http://www.forbes.com/colleges/university-of-rhode-island/'>University of Rhode Island</a> have their pick of four stores within walking or biking distance.\r\n\r\nStudents at <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/colleges/pennsylvania-state-university-main-campus/\">Pennsylvania State University</a>, meanwhile, can walk to three CVS stores from the center of campus in less than 10 minutes. They can also hop in a car and drive to a fourth CVS store in six minutes.\r\n\r\nKevin Lam, a rising second-semester senior at Penn State, says CVS is convenient for students who come down with colds. &ldquo;At the student health center, you have to make an appointment for three days after,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;So you would probably go to CVS to buy an over-the-counter medicine.&rdquo;\r\n\r\nThis September, CVS <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/brucejapsen/2014/09/03/cvs-stops-tobacco-sales-today-changes-name-to-reflect-new-era/\">removed all tobacco products</a> from its shelves to better align with its commitment to health care. CEO Larry Merlo estimated at the time that the groundbreaking move would cut $2 billion from annual sales, or around 3% of company revenue.\r\n<!--nextpage-->\r\nBut the decision probably made few waves on campuses, as tobacco addiction among teens has hit new lows. From 2000 to 2012, the percentage of college students who reported smoking daily <a href=\"http://www.livestrong.com/article/175934-tobacco-addiction-smoking-among-college-students/\">saw a steep drop</a> from 18% to 5%. Alcohol, which is sold in around half of CVS stores depending on local regulations, holds much greater appeal. In a&nbsp;<a href=\"http://pubs.niaaa.nih.gov/publications/CollegeFactSheet/CollegeFactSheet.pdf\">2013 survey</a> by the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, 60% of college students reported drinking alcohol in the past month.\r\n\r\nCVS joins the fast food restaurant [entity display=\"Chipotle Mexican Grill\" type=\"organization\" subtype=\"company\" active=\"true\" activated=\"true\" deactivated=\"false\" key=\"chipotle-mexican-grill\" ticker=\"CMG\" exchange=\"NYSE\" natural_id=\"fred/company/5997\"]Chipotle Mexican Grill[/entity] in positioning its stores near large student populations. Executives at Chipotle, which had a net revenue of $3.21 billion in 2013, understand that customized burrito orders and students searching for quick, trendy meals make the perfect pairing. They also understand that many employees are college students &ndash; the chain <a href=\"http://money.cnn.com/2015/06/08/news/chipotle-tuition-repayment-sick-pay/index.html\">announced last week</a>&nbsp;that it would offer hourly workers tuition reimbursement, among other benefits, effective July 1.\r\n\r\n<iframe src=\"https://www.google.com/maps/d/embed?mid=zs6IreEMw61E.kaZreFDdhtbs\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\"></iframe>\r\nStudents at the <a href='http://www.forbes.com/colleges/university-of-arizona/'>University of Arizona</a> can find nine Chipotles within driving distance of the sprawling, 179-building campus. That&rsquo;s one Chipotle for every 20 academic, administrative or residential buildings.\r\n\r\nAt the University of Maryland, students can walk four minutes to the closest Chipotle or drive less than 11 minutes to two more. And a lot of students are walking to the closest one, making it the <a href=\"http://ugtimes.com/2015/01/lifestyle/chipotle-and-college-students-an-inseparable-bond-that-cannot-be-broken/\">second-highest grossing</a> Chipotle in the country.\r\n\r\nKameron Hudson, a rising senior at the <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/colleges/university-of-oklahoma-norman-campus/\">University of Oklahoma</a>, says he eats at Chipotle around three times a week during the school year. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a five-minute walk from my house, so it&rsquo;s really close and convenient,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;The other reason it&rsquo;s appealing is that it&rsquo;s relatively healthy compared to eating at McDonald&rsquo;s.&rdquo;\r\n\r\nOn the sweet side, the bakery chain <a href=\"https://insomniacookies.com/\">Insomnia Cookies</a> also makes a point of catering to college students. More than 80% of its 68 stores nationwide are located on or near college campuses, says Megan Bruton, senior director of marketing for Insomnia Cookies.\r\n\r\nThe bakery chain was born in a dorm room at the <a href='http://www.forbes.com/colleges/university-of-pennsylvania/'>University of Pennsylvania</a> in 2003, when then-student Seth Berkowitz recognized the need for a delivery service that would satisfy students&rsquo; sweet tooths, Bruton says. Today, students at schools ranging from the <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/colleges/university-of-michigan-ann-arbor/\">University of Michigan</a> to <a href='http://www.forbes.com/colleges/missouri-state-university/'>Missouri State University</a> can call Insomnia Cookies to have warm cookies &ndash; along with milk or ice cream &ndash; delivered to their dorms until 3 a.m.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;After the bars have closed or after late-night study sessions, you&rsquo;re generally hungry and have that craving,&rdquo; Bruton says.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Even as we&rsquo;ve grown into metropolitan areas like Philadelphia and New York, we definitely keep college students&rsquo; desires and expectations at the forefront of what we do,&rdquo; she adds. &ldquo;We can definitely be in the market without campuses, but we do like to be nearby.&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;</p>","description":"CVS Caremark, the country’s largest pharmacy company in overall sales with a net worth of $117.4 billion, has started viewing college students as a significant consumer base.","type":"blog","storyType":"post","uri":"http://www.forbes.com/sites/maxinejoselow/2015/06/11/the-rise-of-chain-stores-on-college-campuses/","comments":[],"visible":true,"blogId":"3780","authors":[{"naturalId":"blogAuthorId/blog/author/1732568","name":"Maxine Joselow","avatars":[{"size":136,"image":"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/e1bff018b2dc938e909caae1fc9af699?s=136&amp;d=http%3A%2F%2F0.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2Fad516503a11cd5ca435acc9bb6523536%3Fs%3D136&amp;r=G"},{"size":40,"image":"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/e1bff018b2dc938e909caae1fc9af699?s=40&amp;d=http%3A%2F%2F0.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2Fad516503a11cd5ca435acc9bb6523536%3Fs%3D40&amp;r=G"},{"size":400,"image":"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/e1bff018b2dc938e909caae1fc9af699?s=400&amp;d=http%3A%2F%2F0.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2Fad516503a11cd5ca435acc9bb6523536%3Fs%3D400&amp;r=G"},{"size":62,"image":"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/e1bff018b2dc938e909caae1fc9af699?s=62&amp;d=http%3A%2F%2F0.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2Fad516503a11cd5ca435acc9bb6523536%3Fs%3D62&amp;r=G"}],"url":"http://www.forbes.com/sites/maxinejoselow/","type":"Forbes Staff","profileUrl":"/sites/maxinejoselow/","twitterName":"@maxinejoselow","authorType":"individual","email":"mjoselow@forbes.com","blog":false,"numFollowers":0,"shortBio":"I write about the use and misuse of the college experience.","timestamp":1445787865885,"description":"I cover how students abuse or make the most of their four years on campus through their academic, social, and extracurricular pursuits.

Executives at Chipotle, which had a net revenue of $3.21 billion in 2013, understand that customized burrito orders and students searching for quick, trendy meals make the perfect pairing. They also understand that many employees are college students – the chain <a href=\"http://money.cnn.com/2015/06/08/news/chipotle-tuition-repayment-sick-pay/index.html\">announced last week</a>&nbsp;that it would offer hourly workers tuition reimbursement, among other benefits, effective July 1.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://www.google.com/maps/d/embed?mid=zs6IreEMw61E.kaZreFDdhtbs\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\"></iframe></p>\n<p>Students at the <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/colleges/university-of-arizona/\" target=\"_self\">University of Arizona</a> can find nine Chipotles within driving distance of the sprawling, 179-building campus. That’s one Chipotle for every 20 academic, administrative or residential buildings.</p>\n<p>At the University of Maryland, students can walk four minutes to the closest Chipotle or drive less than 11 minutes to two more. And a lot of students are walking to the closest one, making it the <a href=\"http://ugtimes.com/2015/01/lifestyle/chipotle-and-college-students-an-inseparable-bond-that-cannot-be-broken/\">second-highest grossing</a> Chipotle in the country.</p>\n<div id=\"inread\" article-ad-inbody=\"inread\" class=\"inread\"></div>\n<p>Kameron Hudson, a rising senior at the <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/colleges/university-of-oklahoma-norman-campus/\" target=\"_self\">University of Oklahoma</a>, says he eats at Chipotle around three times a week during the school year. “It’s a five-minute walk from my house, so it’s really close and convenient,” he says. “The other reason it’s appealing is that it’s relatively healthy compared to eating at McDonald’s.”</p>\n<p>On the sweet side, the bakery chain <a href=\"https://insomniacookies.com/\">Insomnia Cookies</a> also makes a point of catering to college students. More than 80% of its 68 stores nationwide are located on or near college campuses, says Megan Bruton, senior director of marketing for Insomnia Cookies.</p>\n<div class=\"vestpocket\" vest-pocket=\"\"></div>\n<p>The bakery chain was born in a dorm room at the <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/colleges/university-of-pennsylvania/\" target=\"_self\">University of Pennsylvania</a> in 2003, when then-student Seth Berkowitz recognized the need for a delivery service that would satisfy students’ sweet tooths, Bruton says.
