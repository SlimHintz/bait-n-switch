type=\"organization\" subtype=\"company\" active=\"true\" key=\"apple\" ticker=\"AAPL\" exchange=\"NASDAQ\" natural_id=\"fred/company/280\"]Apple[/entity] finally announced its streaming service, which will follow the company&rsquo;s naming trend and simply be known as &ldquo;Apple Music&rdquo;.\r\n\r\nComing to iOs users on June 30th (and Android users in the fall at an undetermined time), Apple Music is <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/hughmcintyre/2015/04/14/apple-might-be-planning-on-following-in-tidals-exclusive-footsteps/\">following</a> in Tidal&rsquo;s brave footsteps by only offering the service for free as a trial membership. After three months of using the updated app, users will either have to decide to look elsewhere for their streaming needs, or fork over $9.99 a month. Families can subscribe to six totally separate accounts for just $14.99 a month, saving them a bundle.\r\n\r\nAs it stands now, there isn&rsquo;t a whole lot that makes Apple Music stand out from the crowd. The company is stressing its wonderful human curation, which others are also hard at work on, and which can never be fully perfected, no matter who is behind the music. Also mentioned was the beautiful look of the app, which is based on featuring high-quality images of artists when you look them up. This does make the service visually appealing, but it's not an <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/hughmcintyre/2015/05/27/the-best-looking-streaming-service-out-there-mixradio-launches-a-beautiful-new-app/\">original idea</a> either.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_476367236\" align=\"\" width=\"640\"]<img class=\"dam-image getty size-large wp-image-476367236\" src=\"http://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/476367236/640x0.jpg?fit=scale\" alt=\"\"> SAN FRANCISCO, CA - JUNE 08: Jimmy Iovine announces Apple Music during Apple WWDC on June 8, 2015 in San Francisco, California. Apple's annual developers conference runs through June 12. (Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)[/caption]\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nIn the end, whether the service itself is better or worse than the others may not matter. When there are half a billion people who already have the app as it launches, it&rsquo;s poised to become one of the most powerful services in no time.\r\n\r\nThe new streaming service has three sections to it, all of which are housed in one app under the new moniker: Apple Music, Beats 1, and Connect. Here&rsquo;s a rundown on what each one does.\r\n\r\n<b>Apple&nbsp;Music</b>\r\nThis is a neat mixing of your already-existing music collection and a traditional streaming site.&nbsp;Apple&nbsp;Music will put those songs and albums that you&rsquo;ve purchased over the years&mdash;whether from iTunes or even from traditional CDs that were then ripped to your computer (remember having to do that?)&mdash;alongside the 30 million tracks available in their library. Now, that&rsquo;s just the on-demand option available.\r\n\r\nIn addition to a massive catalog of songs and albums to choose from, the app will also feature playlists, both created by you and from some of the best talent available in the industry, which have all been brought on by&nbsp;Apple&nbsp;itself. Actual people will be creating playlists all the time, and the app will be able to suggest ones based on what music you own and what you&rsquo;ve been streaming. For those playlists that you've made, you can add your own album art (a photo that seems to fit with the music, perhaps), or stick with the album art provided.\r\n<!--nextpage-->\r\n<b>Beats 1</b>\r\nAfter spending billions on the streaming service last year, it is interesting that&nbsp;Apple&nbsp;has decided to keep the brand&rsquo;s name around, using it as the title of their streaming radio. With stations in London, Los Angeles, and New York City, Beats 1 looks like it will operate as an actual radio station. In fact, during the presentation,&nbsp;Apple&nbsp;took aim at&nbsp;[entity display=\"Pandora\" type=\"organization\" subtype=\"company\" active=\"true\" key=\"pandora\" natural_id=\"fred/company/80300\"]Pandora[/entity]&nbsp;(vaguely), saying &ldquo;internet radio isn&rsquo;t really radio&rdquo;.\r\n\r\nBeats 1 will have different stations, playing every different genre and even including interviews and a lot of other content, much as other options like Sirius does.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_8241\" align=\"\" width=\"1940\"]<img class=\"size-large wp-image-8241\" src=\"http://blogs-images.forbes.com/hughmcintyre/files/2015/06/iPhone6-3Up-AppleMusic-Features-PR-PRINT-1-1940x1284.jpg\" alt=\"A look at Apple Music (courtesy photo from Apple, via Business Wire)\"> A look at Apple Music (courtesy photo from Apple, via Business Wire)[/caption]\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<b>Connect</b>\r\nFor months now, it has been known that Apple's streaming service&nbsp;would have a social component, and that it would be one of the differentiators between its new program and the others that are already out there. Artists both big and small will have their own pages on Connect, where they&rsquo;ll be able to share everything, including live videos, photos, lyrics, and anything else they can think of. There will be commenting from both the artist and fans, and those watching for updates will be able to share those things uploaded by the artist via other social platforms, like [entity display=\"Twitter\" type=\"organization\" subtype=\"company\" active=\"true\" key=\"twitter\" ticker=\"TWTR\" exchange=\"NYSE\" natural_id=\"fred/company/102047\"]Twitter[/entity] and <a href='http://www.forbes.com/facebook-ipo/'>Facebook (which is fitting, seeing as it looks like a newsfeed)</a>.\r\n\r\nThe app will work in tandem with Siri, which looks like it will be able to intelligently suggest music for you should you ask it. For example, during the demonstration earlier today, Siri was asked questions like &ldquo;Play me the top songs from 1982&rdquo;, or &ldquo;Play the top ten in alternative rock&rdquo;, both of which she got right. This isn&rsquo;t necessarily anything new, but now Siri has an enormous catalog to cull from.\r\n\r\nSo, this is the major musical overhaul that's been rumored for so long. Will it end up being a serious player in the streaming industry? That won't be clear for a while, at least until it launches at the end of the month.\r\n\r\n[gallery2012]\r\n\r\n&nbsp;</p>","description":"Today at its annual Worldwide Developer’s Conference, Apple finally announced its streaming service, which will follow the company’s naming trend and simply be known as “Apple Music”.

Android users in the fall at an undetermined time), Apple Music is <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/hughmcintyre/2015/04/14/apple-might-be-planning-on-following-in-tidals-exclusive-footsteps/\"

Families can subscribe to six totally separate accounts for just $14.99 a month, saving them a bundle.</p>\n<p>As it stands now, there isn’t a whole lot that makes Apple Music stand out from the crowd. The company is stressing its wonderful human curation, which others are also hard at work on, and which can never be fully perfected, no matter who is behind the music. Also mentioned was the beautiful look of the app, which is based on featuring high-quality images of artists when you look them up. This does make the service visually appealing, but it’s not an <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/hughmcintyre/2015/05/27/the-best-looking-streaming-service-out-there-mixradio-launches-a-beautiful-new-app/\" target=\"_self\">original idea</a> either.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_476367236\"> \n <img class=\"dam-image getty size-large wp-image-476367236\" src=\"http://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/476367236/640x0.jpg?fit=scale\" alt=\"\" /> \n <p class=\"wp-caption-text\">SAN FRANCISCO, CA – JUNE 08: Jimmy Iovine announces Apple Music during Apple WWDC on June 8, 2015 in San Francisco, California.

(Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)</p> \n</div>\n<div id=\"inread\" article-ad-inbody=\"inread\" class=\"inread\"></div>\n<p>In the end, whether the service itself is better or worse than the others may not matter. When there are half a billion people who already have the app as it launches, it’s poised to become one of the most powerful services in no time.</p>\n<p>The new streaming service has three sections to it, all of which are housed in one app under the new moniker: Apple Music, Beats 1, and Connect. Here’s a rundown on what each one does.</p>\n<p><b>Apple&nbsp;Music</b></p>\n<div class=\"vestpocket\" vest-pocket=\"\"></div>\n<p>This is a neat mixing of your already-existing music collection and a traditional streaming site.&nbsp;Apple&nbsp;Music will put those songs and albums that you’ve purchased over the years—whether from iTunes or even from traditional CDs that were then ripped to your computer (remember having to do that?)—alongside the 30 million tracks available in their library. Now, that’s just the on-demand option available.</p>\n<p>In addition to a massive catalog of songs and albums to choose from, the app will also feature playlists, both created by you and from some of the best talent available in the industry, which have all been brought on by&nbsp;Apple&nbsp;itself. Actual people will be creating playlists all the time, and the app will be able to suggest ones based on what music you own and what you’ve been streaming. For those playlists that you’ve made, you can add your own album art (a photo that seems to fit with the music, perhaps), or stick with the album art provided.</p>","<p><b>Beats 1</b></p>\n<p>After spending billions on the streaming service last year, it is interesting that&nbsp;Apple&nbsp;has decided to keep the brand’s name around, using it as the title of their streaming radio. With stations in London, Los Angeles, and New York City, Beats 1 looks like it will operate as an actual radio station. In fact, during the presentation,&nbsp;Apple&nbsp;took aim at&nbsp;<span class=\"quotecard\" article-quote-card=\"\" data-ticker=\"null\" data-exchange=\"null\" data-type=\"organization\" data-naturalid=\"fred/company/80300\" data-quotes-closing=\"0.0\" data-quotes-now=\"0.0\" data-link=\"/companies/pandora\" data-name=\"Pandora\"></span>&nbsp;(vaguely), saying “internet radio isn’t really radio”.</p>\n<p>Beats 1 will have different stations, playing every different genre and even including interviews and a lot of other content, much as other options like Sirius does.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_8241\"> \n <img class=\"size-large wp-image-8241\" src=\"http://blogs-images.forbes.com/hughmcintyre/files/2015/06/iPhone6-3Up-AppleMusic-Features-PR-PRINT-1-1940x1284.jpg\" alt=\"A look at Apple Music (courtesy photo from Apple, via Business Wire)\" /> \n <p class=\"wp-caption-text\">A look at Apple Music (courtesy photo from Apple, via Business Wire)</p> \n</div>\n<div id=\"inread\" article-ad-inbody=\"inread\" class=\"inread\"></div>\n<p><b>Connect</b></p>\n<p>For months now, it has been known that Apple’s streaming service&nbsp;would have a social component, and that it would be one of the differentiators between its new program and the others that are already out there. Artists both big and small will have their own pages on Connect, where they’ll be able to share everything, including live videos, photos, lyrics, and anything else they can think of. There will be commenting from both the artist and fans, and those watching for updates will be able to share those things uploaded by the artist via other social platforms, like <span class=\"quotecard\" article-quote-card=\"\" data-ticker=\"TWTR\" data-exchange=\"NYSE\" data-type=\"organization\" data-naturalid=\"fred/company/102047\" data-quotes-closing=\"29.15\" data-quotes-now=\"30.28\" data-link=\"/companies/twitter\" data-name=\"Twitter\"></span> and <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/facebook-ipo/\" target=\"_self\">Facebook (which is fitting, seeing as it looks like a newsfeed)</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"vestpocket\" vest-pocket=\"\"></div>\n<p>The app will work in tandem with Siri, which looks like it will be able to intelligently suggest music for you should you ask it. For example, during the demonstration earlier today, Siri was asked questions like “Play me the top songs from 1982”, or “Play the top ten in alternative rock”, both of which she got right. This isn’t necessarily anything new, but now Siri has an enormous catalog to cull from.</p>\n<p>So, this is the major musical overhaul that’s been rumored for so long. Will it end up being a serious player in the streaming industry? That won’t be clear for a while, at least until it launches at the end of the month.</p>\n<div class=\"article-gallery-embedded\" data-url=\"http://www.forbes.com/pictures/geeg45lfgl/ldb46jpc9zcsq71469kqaxj9/\"> \n <div class=\"embedded-content clearfix\"> \n  <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/pictures/geeg45lfgl/ldb46jpc9zcsq71469kqaxj9/\" class=\"clearfix\" target=\"_self\"> \n   <div class=\"article-image-box\"> \n    <!--start:main_image--> \n    <img src=\"http://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/90d2a9ce288a1536e42bc66a739344f3/400x400.jpg?fit=scale&amp;background=000000\" alt=\"\" /> \n    <!--end:main_image--> \n   </div> \n   <div class=\"article-text-box\"> \n    <header> \n     <i class=\"icon icon-gallery\"></i>Gallery \n    </header> \n    <h4>Apple WWDC 2014</h4> \n    <div class=\"article-launch-gallery\"> \n     <span class=\"article-launch-text\">Launch Gallery</span> \n     <div class=\"article-slide-count\">\n       3 images \n     </div> \n    </div> \n    <button class=\"article-launch-button\"><i class=\"icon icon-chevron-right\"></i></button> \n   </div></a> \n </div> \n</div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>"],"galleryId":"54f4e703da47a54de8244516","disableDigest":false,"writtenByForbesStaff":false,"channelSectionMappings":[{"id":"channel_1","channelName":"Business","url":"/business"},{"id":"channel_1section_3","channelName":"Business","sectionName":"Media & Entertainment","url":"/media-entertainment"},{"id":"channel_3section_22","channelName":"Tech","sectionName":"Mobile","url":"/mobile"},{"id":"channel_7section_94","channelName":"Lifestyle","sectionName":"Arts & Entertainment","url":"/arts-entertainment"}],"individualAuthor":{"naturalId":"blogAuthorId/blog/author/1196021","name":"Hugh McIntyre","avatars":[{"size":40,"image":"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/853c59789c520784fcfecc68c6c34217?s=40&amp;d=http%3A%2F%2F0.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2Fad516503a11cd5ca435acc9bb6523536%3Fs%3D40&amp;r=G"},{"size":62,"image":"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/853c59789c520784fcfecc68c6c34217?s=62&amp;d=http%3A%2F%2F0.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2Fad516503a11cd5ca435acc9bb6523536%3Fs%3D62&amp;r=G"},{"size":136,"image":"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/853c59789c520784fcfecc68c6c34217?s=136&amp;d=http%3A%2F%2F0.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2Fad516503a11cd5ca435acc9bb6523536%3Fs%3D136&amp;r=G"},{"size":400,"image":"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/853c59789c520784fcfecc68c6c34217?s=400&amp;d=http%3A%2F%2F0.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2Fad516503a11cd5ca435acc9bb6523536%3Fs%3D400&amp;r=G"}],"url":"http://www.forbes.com/sites/hughmcintyre/","type":"Contributor","profileUrl":"/sites/hughmcintyre/","twitterName":"@popbanghugh","authorType":"individual","email":"hughmcintyre1@gmail.com","blog":false,"numFollowers":0,"shortBio":"I write about the music industry, from tech to charts and more.","timestamp":1445787842098,"description":"I am a freelance pop music journalist in New York City.
