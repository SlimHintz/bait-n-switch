I've wandered from wire services, to newspapers, to magazines, to television -- and finally the Internet. I honored a picket line at <em>The New York Times</em> in the 70s. I was laid off in the 80s during an ad slump, then again in the 90s after a corporate sale. I lived through the decline and irrelevance of newsweeklies, cable tv's assault on broadcast news and evaporating newsrooms across the country. I survived four CEOs at AOL. I started a news company to tap into social media only months before Lehman Brothers imploded. Forty years into this business, nothing compares to what I'm living today. The Age of the Millennial is upon us, and it's shaking the very foundations of the news business.\r\n<!--donotpaginate-->\r\nCheck out the graphics below. Millennials are the force behind a handful of news insurgents. They represent a critical audience segment for others. It's more than their numbers -- by some estimates, 50% of the workforce by 2020. It's the behavior. They're inseparable from phones and social networks. FORBES is right in the middle of it. As the charts show, Forbes.com reaches 11% of millennials across the Web. They're 30% of our total audience. My focus goes deeper: 50% of our total audience is mobile (40% smartphones, 10% tablet); we have 18 million smartphone-only visitors, bigger than our total audience five years ago; 85% of our U.S. referrals from Facebook and Twitter are via the phone. Add it all up: two-thirds of our smartphone-only visitors are millennials.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_13902\" align=\"\" width=\"1200\"]<a href=\"http://blogs-images.forbes.com/lewisdvorkin/files/2015/05/Millennial-11.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-13902 size-full\" src=\"http://blogs-images.forbes.com/lewisdvorkin/files/2015/05/Millennial-12.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a> Forbes.com's millennial reach across the Web has grown dramatically with the launch of our contributor network, a content and social strategy all in one, and the growing popularity of the FORBES 30 Under 30 List, now in its fourth year.[/caption]\r\n\r\nThat's a mouthful of numbers that say one thing: [tweet_quote display=\"The digital article page as we know it with the classic 600-800 word story is in a race against time.\"]the digital article page as we know it with the classic 600-800 word story is in a race against time.[/tweet_quote] The millennial-mobile-social combo is certain to kill it off as the main driver in the hunt for daily audience. Marketers and agencies know it, which is why they pay so little for desktop-like banners inside posts on phones. Easy scrolling on hand-held devices won't stop the inevitable either. Visitors to Forbes.com are no more likely to scroll down a sea of gray paragraphs on phones than they are on laptops or desktops.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_13899\" align=\"\" width=\"1200\"]<a href=\"http://blogs-images.forbes.com/lewisdvorkin/files/2015/05/Millennial-1.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-13899 size-full\" src=\"http://blogs-images.forbes.com/lewisdvorkin/files/2015/05/Millennial-1.jpg\" alt=\"Millennial 1\"></a> Our Millennial reach means that demographic makes up 30% of our digital audience.[/caption]\r\n\r\nJournalists must start to think of their work in dramatically different terms. How they create, organize and display digital content needs to change. [tweet_quote display=\"Content engines, old and new, need to be reconfigured to match the trifecta of audience, device and context.\"]Content engines, old and new, need to be reconfigured to match the trifecta of audience, device and context.[/tweet_quote] &nbsp;Is the consumer on the beach, the train, having a cup of coffee or racing from meeting to meeting? Most journalists have taken to&nbsp;140-character Twitter bursts to get their message out. Oddly, Facebook is reinforcing old ways in The Age of the Millennial. With help of an army of Facebook and <em>NYT</em> developers, the old Gray Lady published its first <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/lewisdvorkin/2015/05/18/the-meaning-of-facebook-instant-stories-as-the-french-would-say-plus-ca-change/\">Instant Article</a> a few weeks ago, meaning thousands of words loaded instantly on a mobile phone. The question remains, how many actually read its girth on&nbsp;Facebook's&nbsp;app?\r\n\r\nReal solutions need to come from within. For us, the journey began five years ago with <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/lewisdvorkin/2011/06/12/forbes-update-our-newsroom-for-the-digital-era-is-now-up-and-running/\">The New Newsroom</a>. That's when we introduced a <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/lewisdvorkin/2012/03/27/inside-forbes-the-9-key-steps-weve-taken-to-disrupt-the-traditional-news-business/\">new publishing platform</a>, launched an <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/lewisdvorkin/2014/04/01/inside-forbes-the-role-of-pay-and-traffic-in-our-search-for-a-new-media-equation/\">incentive-based contributor model</a> and <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/lewisdvorkin/2015/01/15/inside-forbes-my-brief-shining-moment-as-a-super-journalist/\">made data central</a> to our journalistic efforts. <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/lewisdvorkin/2013/09/23/inside-forbes-the-role-of-native-advertising-in-our-search-for-a-new-media-equation/\">The flip side </a>of that was BrandVoice, a new ad model that opened our editorial content management system to our marketing partners. Those moves, once considered radical, provided expert content with a cost efficiency that works in a world of mobile CPMs -- lower than both desktop and print ad rates.&nbsp;Now, it's time for an even newer newsroom culture that acknowledges the convergence of content, business models, audience behavior and formats.<span class=\"tweet_icon\"></span>\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_13905\" align=\"\" width=\"1200\"]<a href=\"http://blogs-images.forbes.com/lewisdvorkin/files/2015/05/Millennial-2.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-13905 size-full\" src=\"http://blogs-images.forbes.com/lewisdvorkin/files/2015/05/Millennial-2.jpg\" alt=\"Millennial 2\"></a> Multiplatform includes desktop, tablet and smartphone domestic visitors. Mobile is smartphone visitors only.[/caption]\r\n\r\n\r\nWith the mobile juggernaut in mind (see chart above), we started taking action two years ago. In September 2013, we launched <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/forbeslife/\">ForbesLife.com</a>. The goal was to be more visual on phones and tablets, using new underlying technology we hoped could power much more. In fact, it did. A few months later we launched visually enhanced <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/lewisdvorkin/2014/10/16/inside-forbes-introducing-a-new-kind-of-home-page-for-journalists-and-our-native-ad-partners/\">author home pages</a>. Six months after that we began testing an <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/lewisdvorkin/2015/04/08/inside-forbes-our-new-article-page-puts-mobile-native-ads-and-social-front-and-center/\">updated article page</a>&nbsp;(you're on it now).&nbsp;It's a bit traditional, for sure, but it works with many device sizes and addresses head-on the realities that marketers will only pay for those ads actually seen. Even more adventurous efforts tied to our brand mission are only months away:\r\n\r\n<strong>30 Under 30 App:</strong>&nbsp;<span>Launched in 2012, the <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/30under30/#/\">FORBES 30 Under 30 List</a> has given us a good look into the exploding world of millennials. Four lists later, we bought a startup (Camerama) and its photo-sharing app to help us build a platform of apps for passionate communities. First up is a social network-like app for 3,000 Under 30 list members, a group of influencers coveted by marketers. It will be introduced at our next&nbsp;<a href='http://www.forbes.com/under30summit/'>Under 30 Summit</a> in Philadelphia in October. We're testing the alpha version now, then a private beta with events in San Francisco and New York. One exciting launch feature: Speed-networking functionality powered by Tinder. Our BrandVoice native ad platform will play a critical role in an environment that demands a different kind of messaging from marketers.</span>\r\n\r\n<strong>Under 30 Channel:</strong>&nbsp;Our velvet-rope native app will come alive on Forbes.com in scalable fashion. Using the technology behind ForbesLife.com and our new article pages, we'll deliver a visually-enhanced Under 30 smartphone experience that will travel across other platforms -- on and off domain. The life and times of millennial entrepreneurs will be expressed in quick bursts of text, video, photos and graphics, some of it coming from list members themselves as part of a new group of Forbes contributors. New kinds of marketing messages will also prevail, based on the notion that exposure time to key audiences is what matters most. Look for similar app community-Web content combinations in 2016.\r\n\r\n<strong><span style=\"color: #000000\"><span>Internal Mobile&nbsp;Incubator</span></span>:</strong>&nbsp;New browser formats are required for on-the-go consumers, who still largely depend on the mobile Web for news. In turn, that will necessitate integrating marketing messages in new ways, far more like native ads then display ads. We've already learned a lot from our <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/forbespr/2015/03/16/forbes-media-acquires-private-photo-sharing-app-camerama/\">purchase of Camerama</a>.&nbsp;Focus groups with our Under 30 list members provided additional insights. Now we plan to carve out office space for editors and reporters to work with developers, product, video and sales people to deconstruct the traditional article page for mobile distribution, consumption, sharing and monetization.\r\n\r\n<strong>Social&nbsp;Video:</strong><span>&nbsp;We're methodically implementing a strategy suited for the evolving world of video distribution. That means marrying new video styles (TV's talking heads are a thing of the past) and treatments with content that plays well with all three initiatives above as well as social networks. Of course, we'll do that with our mission and brand values always front and center.&nbsp;</span>\r\n\r\nMillennials. Mobile. Social. They are catalysts for the latest grand forces that have been in play for years. From offline to online. From printing presses to the Web. From quotes to sound bites. From TV to cable. From newspapers to blogging. From message boards to social networks. The lexicon will continue to evolve as technology drives new generations to change their behavior. Media institutions adjust with fearful, stubborn reluctance, always losing valuable time. Now is the moment to get on with it, building the experience consumers want on the platform of their choice.</p>","description":"I go back a ways.

I’ve wandered from wire services, to newspapers, to magazines, to television — and finally the Internet. I honored a picket line at <em>The New York Times</em> in the 70s. I was laid off in the 80s during an ad slump, then again in the 90s after a corporate sale. I lived through the decline and irrelevance of newsweeklies, cable tv’s assault on broadcast news and evaporating newsrooms across the country. I survived four CEOs at AOL. I started a news company to tap into social media only months before Lehman Brothers imploded. Forty years into this business, nothing compares to what I’m living today. The Age of the Millennial is upon us, and it’s shaking the very foundations of the news business.</p>\n<p>Check out the graphics below. Millennials are the force behind a handful of news insurgents. They represent a critical audience segment for others. It’s more than their numbers — by some estimates, 50% of the workforce by 2020. It’s the behavior. They’re inseparable from phones and social networks. FORBES is right in the middle of it. As the charts show, Forbes.com reaches 11% of millennials across the Web. They’re 30% of our total audience. My focus goes deeper: 50% of our total audience is mobile (40% smartphones, 10% tablet); we have 18 million smartphone-only visitors, bigger than our total audience five years ago; 85% of our U.S. referrals from Facebook and Twitter are via the phone. Add it all up: two-thirds of our smartphone-only visitors are millennials.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_13902\"> \n <a href=\"http://blogs-images.forbes.com/lewisdvorkin/files/2015/05/Millennial-11.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-13902 size-full\" src=\"http://blogs-images.forbes.com/lewisdvorkin/files/2015/05/Millennial-12.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></a> \n <p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Forbes.com’s millennial reach across the Web has grown dramatically with the launch of our contributor network, a content and social strategy all in one, and the growing popularity of the FORBES 30 Under 30 List, now in its fourth year.</p> \n</div>\n<p>That’s a mouthful of numbers that say one thing: <span class=\"tweet_quote\"> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A%2F%2Fonforb.es%2F1JFeE8z&amp;text=The%20digital%20article%20page%20as%20we%20know%20it%20with%20the%20classic%20600-800%20word%20story%20is%20in%20a%20race%20against%20time.\" target=\"_blank\">the digital article page as we know it with the classic 600-800 word story is in a race against time.<span></span></a></span> The millennial-mobile-social combo is certain to kill it off as the main driver in the hunt for daily audience. Marketers and agencies know it, which is why they pay so little for desktop-like banners inside posts on phones. Easy scrolling on hand-held devices won’t stop the inevitable either. Visitors to Forbes.com are no more likely to scroll down a sea of gray paragraphs on phones than they are on laptops or desktops.</p>\n<div id=\"inread\" article-ad-inbody=\"inread\" class=\"inread\"></div>\n<div id=\"attachment_13899\"> \n <a href=\"http://blogs-images.forbes.com/lewisdvorkin/files/2015/05/Millennial-1.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-13899 size-full\" src=\"http://blogs-images.forbes.com/lewisdvorkin/files/2015/05/Millennial-1.jpg\" alt=\"Millennial 1\" /></a> \n <p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Our Millennial reach means that demographic makes up 30% of our digital audience.</p> \n</div>\n<p>Journalists must start to think of their work in dramatically different terms.

Most journalists have taken to&nbsp;140-character Twitter bursts to get their message out. Oddly, Facebook is reinforcing old ways in The Age of the Millennial. With help of an army of Facebook and <em>NYT</em> developers, the old Gray Lady published its first <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/lewisdvorkin/2015/05/18/the-meaning-of-facebook-instant-stories-as-the-french-would-say-plus-ca-change/\" target=\"_self\">Instant Article</a> a few weeks ago, meaning thousands of words loaded instantly on a mobile phone. The question remains, how many actually read its girth on&nbsp;Facebook’s&nbsp;app?</p>\n<p>Real solutions need to come from within. For us, the journey began five years ago with <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/lewisdvorkin/2011/06/12/forbes-update-our-newsroom-for-the-digital-era-is-now-up-and-running/\" target=\"_self\">The New Newsroom</a>.

Those moves, once considered radical, provided expert content with a cost efficiency that works in a world of mobile CPMs — lower than both desktop and print ad rates.&nbsp;Now, it’s time for an even newer newsroom culture that acknowledges the convergence of content, business models, audience behavior and formats.<span class=\"tweet_icon\"></span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_13905\"> \n <a href=\"http://blogs-images.forbes.com/lewisdvorkin/files/2015/05/Millennial-2.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-13905 size-full\" src=\"http://blogs-images.forbes.com/lewisdvorkin/files/2015/05/Millennial-2.jpg\" alt=\"Millennial 2\" /></a> \n <p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Multiplatform includes desktop, tablet and smartphone domestic visitors. Mobile is smartphone visitors only.</p> \n</div>\n<p>With the mobile juggernaut in mind (see chart above), we started taking action two years ago. In September 2013, we launched <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/forbeslife/\" target=\"_self\">ForbesLife.com</a>. The goal was to be more visual on phones and tablets, using new underlying technology we hoped could power much more. In fact, it did. A few months later we launched visually enhanced <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/lewisdvorkin/2014/10/16/inside-forbes-introducing-a-new-kind-of-home-page-for-journalists-and-our-native-ad-partners/\" target=\"_self\">author home pages</a>. Six months after that we began testing an <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/lewisdvorkin/2015/04/08/inside-forbes-our-new-article-page-puts-mobile-native-ads-and-social-front-and-center/\" target=\"_self\">updated article page</a>&nbsp;(you’re on it now).&nbsp;It’s a bit traditional, for sure, but it works with many device sizes and addresses head-on the realities that marketers will only pay for those ads actually seen. Even more adventurous efforts tied to our brand mission are only months away:</p>\n<p><strong>30 Under 30 App:</strong>&nbsp;<span>Launched in 2012, the <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/30under30/#/\" target=\"_self\">FORBES 30 Under 30 List</a> has given us a good look into the exploding world of millennials. Four lists later, we bought a startup (Camerama) and its photo-sharing app to help us build a platform of apps for passionate communities. First up is a social network-like app for 3,000 Under 30 list members, a group of influencers coveted by marketers. It will be introduced at our next&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/under30summit/\" target=\"_self\">Under 30 Summit</a> in Philadelphia in October. We’re testing the alpha version now, then a private beta with events in San Francisco and New York. One exciting launch feature: Speed-networking functionality powered by Tinder. Our BrandVoice native ad platform will play a critical role in an environment that demands a different kind of messaging from marketers.</span></p>\n<p><strong>Under 30 Channel:</strong>&nbsp;Our velvet-rope native app will come alive on Forbes.com in scalable fashion. Using the technology behind ForbesLife.com and our new article pages, we’ll deliver a visually-enhanced Under 30 smartphone experience that will travel across other platforms — on and off domain. The life and times of millennial entrepreneurs will be expressed in quick bursts of text, video, photos and graphics, some of it coming from list members themselves as part of a new group of Forbes contributors. New kinds of marketing messages will also prevail, based on the notion that exposure time to key audiences is what matters most. Look for similar app community-Web content combinations in 2016.</p>\n<div class=\"vestpocket\" vest-pocket=\"\"></div>\n<p><strong><span style=\"color: #000000\"><span>Internal Mobile&nbsp;Incubator</span></span>:</strong>&nbsp;New browser formats are required for on-the-go consumers, who still largely depend on the mobile Web for news. In turn, that will necessitate integrating marketing messages in new ways, far more like native ads then display ads. We’ve already learned a lot from our <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/forbespr/2015/03/16/forbes-media-acquires-private-photo-sharing-app-camerama/\" target=\"_self\">purchase of Camerama</a>.&nbsp;Focus groups with our Under 30 list members provided additional insights. Now we plan to carve out office space for editors and reporters to work with developers, product, video and sales people to deconstruct the traditional article page for mobile distribution, consumption, sharing and monetization.</p>\n<p><strong>Social&nbsp;Video:</strong><span>&nbsp;We’re methodically implementing a strategy suited for the evolving world of video distribution. That means marrying new video styles (TV’s talking heads are a thing of the past) and treatments with content that plays well with all three initiatives above as well as social networks. Of course, we’ll do that with our mission and brand values always front and center.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p>Millennials. Mobile. Social.
