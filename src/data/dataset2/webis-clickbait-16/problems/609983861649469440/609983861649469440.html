Can Say Is 'No' (And How To Do It)","date":1433971260000,"timestamp":1434038038906,"body":"<p>In a professional universe that can seem to hinge on a woman's willingness to always say \"yes,\" sometimes the most powerful thing she can do is say an unequivocal \"no.\"\r\n\r\nThe power of that two-letter word--a sentence in itself--was the topic of a panel featuring Julissa Arce, Director of Public Affairs at Define American; Deborah Dugan, CEO of (RED); Sarah Kunst, Investor Board Member at Venture For America; and Melanne Verveer, U.S. Ambaassodor-at-Large for Global Women's Issues at Forbes' third annual Women's Summit in New York on Wednesday.\r\n\r\nModerator <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/deniserestauri/\" target=\"_blank\">Denise Restauri</a>, founder and CEO of GirlQuake, quoted <a href='http://www.forbes.com/steve-jobs/'>Steve Jobs</a>, saying \"People think focus means saying yes to the thing you&rsquo;ve got to focus on. But that&rsquo;s not what it means at all. It means saying no to the 100 other ideas that are there. You have to pick carefully.\"\r\n\r\nHow to choose what \"the thing\" truly is may prove more difficult.\r\n\r\nDugan&nbsp;told the story of turning down an executive recruiter's&nbsp;offer to be CEO of a major corporation, believing the non-profit opportunity of her dreams, where \"instead of making rich people richer\" she could \"do something good,\"&nbsp;might still be out there.\r\n\r\nThe recruiter said to her, \"Would you like to have breakfast with Bono in the morning?\"\r\n\r\nAs &nbsp;result, said Dugan, she and global HIV philanthropy and awareness organization&nbsp;(RED)'s famous co-founder \"spent three hours talking about how you make kids care about things and about what it is in your life that made you care.\"\r\n\r\nLeveraging the deal-making, brand management, and HR skills she wielded on behalf of major for-profit corporations, Dugan became CEO of (RED)--the result of saying no to a lucrative offer when she believed seeking something where she could contribute more was the better decision.\r\n\r\nDoing more was a strong theme for several of the women on the panel, including Julissa Arce.&nbsp;Arce grabbed headlines earlier this year when she shared her story publicly. Having come to the U.S. with her parents at the age of 11, Arce&nbsp;was 14 when her tourist's&nbsp;visa expired, but remained in the U.S., attending and graduating from the University of Texas at Austin and scoring a coveted job at Goldman Sachs. To clear the company's background check, she purchased fake documents.\r\n\r\nAfter marrying an American citizen Arce was able to adjust her citizenship status, and she was bringing in a substantial income as a vice president&nbsp;at Goldman Sachs. Still, she says, she felt incomplete.She recalls thinking, \"I have everything I thought I ever wanted. I have a green card I have a husband and I have a really big paycheck. And yet I feel really empty.\"\r\n\r\n<!--nextpage-->\r\nArce said no to continuing her career on&nbsp;<a href='http://www.forbes.com/wall-street/'>Wall Street</a>, leaving banking and pursuing different projects until she joined Define American to advocate on behalf of immigrants&nbsp;like herself.\r\n\r\n\"I said, 'I have to be a part of this.' I can&rsquo;t be on Wall Street anymore, I have to go and I have to advocate for people who are living the reality that I lived for so many years. I had to say no to my personal ambitions. I wanted to give a voice to so many people who don&rsquo;t have a voice.\"\r\n\r\nNo, however, is not always a word one gets to wield solely in defense of options. Sometimes, it's a statement that has to be made in one's own defense.\r\n\r\n\"I&rsquo;m a black woman in six-inch heels who works in venture capital in Silicon Valley,\" said Kunst, joking, \"I don&rsquo;t stand out!\"\r\n\r\nKunst described using&nbsp;the word no to stem the tide of behavior she feels makes&nbsp;Silicon Valley a \"funnel\" and keeps the tech industry from becoming fully professionally inclusive and diverse.\r\n\r\n\"I have to say no to this culture that thinks it&rsquo;s ok when we have a job interview [for men to say], 'I just don&rsquo;t know if I want to hire you or hit on you.' You say no in the moment but you also say, 'No, this isn&rsquo;t ok.'\"\r\n\r\nBut saying \"no, this isn't ok\" can have its drawbacks, in ways sometimes unexpected. Kunst described her work on diversity and inclusion with Jesse Jackson, saying that standing up and saying no means there are spaces into which she's now not always welcome.\r\n\r\n\"I&rsquo;m blacklisted some places&ndash;no pun intended&mdash;where people say 'She&rsquo;s a troublemaker.'\"\r\n\r\nVerveer pointed out that how one says no--and what you use to back it up--is just as important as the utterance itself.\r\n\r\n\"You can win over your audience by demonstrating it is in their interest when you say no to see it in the way that you see it.&nbsp;You can galvanize&mdash;you don&rsquo;t just say \"no,\" you really make progress, and we all want to be in the progress business,\" said Verveer.\r\n\r\n\"When you say no to the direction somebody wants to go in, substantively, be armed, come with your facts, and you will be viewed in a much more seriously way from then on.\"</p>","description":"In a professional universe that can seem to hinge on a woman's willingness to always say \"yes,\" sometimes the most powerful thing she can do is say an unequivocal \"no.\"","image":"http://blogs-images.forbes.com/kathryndill/files/2015/06/IMG959258-e1433989485273-300x169.jpg","type":"blog","storyType":"post","uri":"http://www.forbes.com/sites/kathryndill/2015/06/10/when-the-most-powerful-thing-you-can-say-is-no-and-how-to-do-it/","comments":[],"visible":true,"promotedChannelSections":[{"channel":"channel_6","section":"section_153","title":"When The Most Powerful Thing You Can Say Is 'No'","description":"In a professional universe that can seem to hinge on a woman's willingness to always say \"yes,\" sometimes the most powerful thing she can do is say an unequivocal \"no.\"","image":"http://blogs-images.forbes.com/kathryndill/files/2015/06/IMG959258-e1433989485273-300x169.jpg","location":"top"}],"blogId":"2681","authors":[{"naturalId":"blogAuthorId/blog/author/540973","name":"Kathryn Dill","avatars":[{"size":136,"image":"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/08b349f3a7e15b6edbd9609189f00ff3?s=136&amp;d=http%3A%2F%2F0.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2Fad516503a11cd5ca435acc9bb6523536%3Fs%3D136&amp;r=G"},{"size":40,"image":"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/08b349f3a7e15b6edbd9609189f00ff3?s=40&amp;d=http%3A%2F%2F0.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2Fad516503a11cd5ca435acc9bb6523536%3Fs%3D40&amp;r=G"},{"size":400,"image":"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/08b349f3a7e15b6edbd9609189f00ff3?s=400&amp;d=http%3A%2F%2F0.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2Fad516503a11cd5ca435acc9bb6523536%3Fs%3D400&amp;r=G"},{"size":62,"image":"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/08b349f3a7e15b6edbd9609189f00ff3?s=62&amp;d=http%3A%2F%2F0.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2Fad516503a11cd5ca435acc9bb6523536%3Fs%3D62&amp;r=G"}],"url":"http://www.forbes.com/sites/kathryndill/","type":"Forbes Staff","profileUrl":"/sites/kathryndill/","twitterName":"KathrynDill","authorType":"individual","email":"kdill@forbes.com","blog":false,"numFollowers":0,"shortBio":"The workforce, the workplace, and the future of both.","timestamp":1445787772010,"description":"I joined the staff of Forbes in 2013, covering leadership topics and researching the world’s wealthiest individuals for the Forbes 400 and World’s Billionaires lists before taking over the Careers beat.

But that’s not what it means at all. It means saying no to the 100 other ideas that are there. You have to pick carefully.”</p>\n<p>How to choose what “the thing” truly is may prove more difficult.</p>\n<p>Dugan&nbsp;told the story of turning down an executive recruiter’s&nbsp;offer to be CEO of a major corporation, believing the non-profit opportunity of her dreams, where “instead of making rich people richer” she could “do something good,”&nbsp;might still be out there.</p>\n<div id=\"inread\" article-ad-inbody=\"inread\" class=\"inread\"></div>\n<p>The recruiter said to her, “Would you like to have breakfast with Bono in the morning?”</p>\n<p>As &nbsp;result, said Dugan, she and global HIV philanthropy and awareness organization&nbsp;(RED)’s famous co-founder “spent three hours talking about how you make kids care about things and about what it is in your life that made you care.”</p>\n<p>Leveraging the deal-making, brand management, and HR skills she wielded on behalf of major for-profit corporations, Dugan became CEO of (RED)–the result of saying no to a lucrative offer when she believed seeking something where she could contribute more was the better decision.</p>\n<div class=\"vestpocket\" vest-pocket=\"\"></div>\n<p>Doing more was a strong theme for several of the women on the panel, including Julissa Arce.&nbsp;Arce grabbed headlines earlier this year when she shared her story publicly. Having come to the U.S. with her parents at the age of 11, Arce&nbsp;was 14 when her tourist’s&nbsp;visa expired, but remained in the U.S., attending and graduating from the University of Texas at Austin and scoring a coveted job at Goldman Sachs. To clear the company’s background check, she purchased fake documents.</p>\n<p>After marrying an American citizen Arce was able to adjust her citizenship status, and she was bringing in a substantial income as a vice president&nbsp;at Goldman Sachs. Still, she says, she felt incomplete.She recalls thinking, “I have everything I thought I ever wanted. I have a green card I have a husband and I have a really big paycheck. And yet I feel really empty.”</p>","<p>Arce said no to continuing her career on&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/wall-street/\" target=\"_self\">Wall Street</a>, leaving banking and pursuing different projects until she joined Define American to advocate on behalf of immigrants&nbsp;like herself.</p>\n<p>“I said, ‘I have to be a part of this.’ I can’t be on Wall Street anymore, I have to go and I have to advocate for people who are living the reality that I lived for so many years. I had to say no to my personal ambitions. I wanted to give a voice to so many people who don’t have a voice.”</p>\n<p>No, however, is not always a word one gets to wield solely in defense of options. Sometimes, it’s a statement that has to be made in one’s own defense.</p>\n<p>“I’m a black woman in six-inch heels who works in venture capital in Silicon Valley,” said Kunst, joking, “I don’t stand out!”</p>\n<p>Kunst described using&nbsp;the word no to stem the tide of behavior she feels makes&nbsp;Silicon Valley a “funnel” and keeps the tech industry from becoming fully professionally inclusive and diverse.</p>\n<div id=\"inread\" article-ad-inbody=\"inread\" class=\"inread\"></div>\n<p>“I have to say no to this culture that thinks it’s ok when we have a job interview [for men to say], ‘I just don’t know if I want to hire you or hit on you.’ You say no in the moment but you also say, ‘No, this isn’t ok.’”</p>\n<p>But saying “no, this isn’t ok” can have its drawbacks, in ways sometimes unexpected. Kunst described her work on diversity and inclusion with Jesse Jackson, saying that standing up and saying no means there are spaces into which she’s now not always welcome.</p>\n<div class=\"vestpocket\" vest-pocket=\"\"></div>\n<p>“I’m blacklisted some places–no pun intended—where people say ‘She’s a troublemaker.’”</p>\n<p>Verveer pointed out that how one says no–and what you use to back it up–is just as important as the utterance itself.</p>\n<p>“You can win over your audience by demonstrating it is in their interest when you say no to see it in the way that you see it.&nbsp;You can galvanize—you don’t just say “no,” you really make progress, and we all want to be in the progress business,” said Verveer.</p>\n<p>“When you say no to the direction somebody wants to go in, substantively, be armed, come with your facts, and you will be viewed in a much more seriously way from then on.”</p>"],"disableDigest":false,"writtenByForbesStaff":true,"channelSectionMappings":[{"id":"channel_6","channelName":"Leadership","url":"/leadership"},{"id":"channel_6section_280","channelName":"Leadership","sectionName":"Win At Work","url":"/ebooks/win-at-work/"},{"id":"channel_6section_37","channelName":"Leadership","sectionName":"Careers","url":"/careers"},{"id":"channel_6section_43","channelName":"Leadership","sectionName":"ForbesWoman","url":"/forbeswoman"}],"images":{"featured":{"url":"http://blogs-images.forbes.com/kathryndill/files/2015/06/IMG959258-e1433989485273-1940x1091.jpg","width":1940,"height":1091,"title":"IMG959258","caption":"L-R: Dugan, Arce, Restauri","description":""}},"brandVoiceTitle":"When The Most Powerful Thing You Can Say Is 'No' (And How To Do It)","digestDisabled":false,"groupAuthor":{"naturalId":"blogAuthorId/blog/author/blog-2681","avatars":[{"size":0},{"size":0},{"size":0},{"size":0}],"url":"http://www.forbes.com/sites/kathryndill/","profileUrl":"http://blogs.forbes.com/kathryndill/profile/","authorType":"individual","linkedIn":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/kathryndill","blog":true,"numFollowers":0,"timestamp":1445791055121,"primaryBlogNaturalId":"blogAuthorId/blog/author/blog-2681","primaryContributor":"blogAuthorId/blog/author/540973","primaryContributorData":{"naturalId":"blogAuthorId/blog/author/540973","name":"Kathryn Dill","avatars":[{"size":40,"image":"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/08b349f3a7e15b6edbd9609189f00ff3?s=40&amp;d=http%3A%2F%2F0.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2Fad516503a11cd5ca435acc9bb6523536%3Fs%3D40&amp;r=G"},{"size":62,"image":"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/08b349f3a7e15b6edbd9609189f00ff3?s=62&amp;d=http%3A%2F%2F0.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2Fad516503a11cd5ca435acc9bb6523536%3Fs%3D62&amp;r=G"},{"size":136,"image":"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/08b349f3a7e15b6edbd9609189f00ff3?s=136&amp;d=http%3A%2F%2F0.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2Fad516503a11cd5ca435acc9bb6523536%3Fs%3D136&amp;r=G"},{"size":400,"image":"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/08b349f3a7e15b6edbd9609189f00ff3?s=400&amp;d=http%3A%2F%2F0.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2Fad516503a11cd5ca435acc9bb6523536%3Fs%3D400&amp;r=G"}],"blog":false,"numFollowers":0,"shortBio":"The workforce, the workplace, and the future of both.","description":"I joined the staff of Forbes in 2013, covering leadership topics and researching the world’s wealthiest individuals for the Forbes 400 and World’s Billionaires lists before taking over the Careers beat.
