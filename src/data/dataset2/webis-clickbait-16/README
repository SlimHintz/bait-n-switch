Webis Clickbait Corpus 2016 (Webis-CBC-16)
==========================================

Date. July 23rd, 2016.


Synopsis
--------

The Webis Clickbait Corpus 2016 (Webis-CBC-16) comprises 2992 Twitter tweets sampled from top 20 news publishers as per retweets in 2014. The tweets have been manually annotated by three independent annotators with regard to whether they can be considered clickbait. A total of 767 tweets are considered clickbait by the majority of annotators. The majority vote of reviewers can be used as a ground truth to build clickbait detection technology. This corpus is the first of its kind and gives rise to the development of technology to tackle clickbait.


Corpus structure
----------------

The corpus is organized as follows:

webis-cbc-16
|
|- problems
|  |- <tweet-id>
|  |  |- <tweet-id>.html
|  |  |- <tweet-id>.json
|  |  |- <tweet-id>.<png|jpg>
|  |  |- <tweet-id>.img-tag
|  |
|  |- ...
|
|- truth
   |- annotatorA.csv
   |- annotatorB.csv
   |- annotatorC.csv
   |- majority.csv

The directory "problems" contains sub-directories where each directory corresponds to a tweet from one of the publishers. Each problem instance contains the following files:

    - an HTML which web page that was linked from the tweet
    - a JSON file containing the tweet and its meta data as per Twitter's API
    - an optional image PNG or JPG file; the media attachment of the tweet
    - an optional IMG-TAG file comprising image tags as computed by Imagga.

The directory truth contains the annotations of the three individual annotators A, B, and C. Each annotator judged a tweet on a 4-point Likert scale as being clickbait, where the scale was as follows:

   - none
   - weak    ^ no clickbait
   -----------------------  
   - medium  v clickbait
   - strong

As discretization, we considered a tweet clickbait, if a reviewer judged it to be medium to strong clickbait. From the discretized votes, we computed the majority votes found in the file "majority.csv". This formed the ground truth for the evaluation of our clickbait detection approach.
